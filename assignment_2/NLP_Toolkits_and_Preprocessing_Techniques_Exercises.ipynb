Natural flavors used in the making are Cinnamon and All Spice.  These flavorings give the cookies a real old-fashioned, homemade taste.<br /><br />Nutritionally, the cookies have   calories each,  .  saturated fat,   mg sodium, and   sugar.

When i opened the cookie wrapper, i gave half of it to my   year old and i ate the other half. I was immediately surprised by how soft the cookie was when i was splitting it in half. It was like a really really good home baked cookie. Soft, chewy and tasty. I normally do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, due to the raisins, but this cookie was surprisingly yummy.

Excellent product to keep on hand or in the diaper bag.', 'I love oatmeal cookies and have made them at least hundred times.  I love my cookies, but these come in a very close second to my under baked, soft homemade \"vanishing oatmeal\" cookies.<br />There\\'s some ingredients in these cookies that I don\\'t find in my kitchen cabinet, but if you\\'re not against prepackaged food, it shouldn\\'t bother you.<br /><br />I loved the allspice taste, but my guy friend didn\\'t that much.  I think he\\'s just partial to my cookies.  The individual serving size is nice.  I\\'m more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale.  I could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and..........<br /><br />They are delicious and make me feel like I\\'m eating something that is somewhat healthy for me.  After all, there is oatmeal in the cookie.', 'I love the soft bakes oatmeal raisin cookies.  The subtle taste of the oatmeal with the natural sweetness of the raisins is wonderful.', 'I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted these oatmeal cookies, they were delicious. It is a great go to snack when you are out and about and need something quick... and the kids love them!', 'This was delicious. I was hesitant about trying it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was so delicious and soft. I like my cookies crunchy and well done. Lol When baking my own I usually lightly burn a few for me. But this cookie was so good. I think I will make an exception for the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisins', \"I received a free sample of these cookies through Influenster and immediately got hooked on them.

I had to purchase more and now we treat ourselves every morning to a yummy cookie.\", 'I loved the texture, the natural taste, and the softness was just right!!! If you are wanting a good cookie to take o the go, or for anytime, this is a very good choice!!', \"First thought--not as good as homemade.  Second thought--good anyways.  Homemade oatmeal cookies are chewy, moist, a slightly crisp outer layer... but these cookies are cakey throughout.  The other thing that sets them apart from homemade cookies is a slight taste of preservatives--or something--something different and packaged-tasting about the flavor.  They're not too sweet, which I like.  My kids have started revolting against granola bars and protein bars as snacks on our day-trips--I think this would be a good thing to take instead.  Filling, good energy boost, tastes better than an energy bar.\", 'These are nice soft, spicy oatmeal cookies with a rich molasses flavor.  They are a perfect single serving size, in a perfect individual wrap.  They have a good taste, natural, not artificial and are a satisfying snack.  I would buy these to take for a snack or lunch.', 'Good store bought cookie comes individually wrapped so every one is fresh.  Has a slightly burnt flavor, the bottoms of the cookies were very dark, almost burnt.  Soft and chewy with a sweet tast, could use more raisins and a stronger oatmeal flavor.  Overall, I liked them and my son loved them.  I guess the younger folks will like how sweet the cookie is.

The first bite was pretty terrible, though they did seem to get better about half way through the cookie.  It was so dry and had a sawdust kind of texture.  I think the problem is the main ingredient is ground up oats, then with whole oats and wheat flour, instead of the recipes I've made with more whole oats and then wheat flour.  Even though I don't really like raisins they were the best thing about these cookies.  At least a bite with a raisin was a tiny bit moister.<br /><br />Not only that but it was   for only one cookie.  If this was a diet cookie, maybe I wouldn't be so harsh about the texture, but   for one cookie sure isn't diet food.<br /><br />  stars.\", 'WOW, I gave it to my son to try and it was gone within SECONDS. Then he goes, \"Mommy, can I have more?\" and I had to then go out and buy some more of these great cookies.

Would definitely buy!', \"Quaker products always mean good tasting.  They also mean a healthier option of processed snacks.  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookies are indeed soft and moist.  Each cookie is over an ounce; a nice size cookie.  You can see the whole oats and raisins.  I can taste the raisins and spices as well.  It is a tasty oatmeal raisin cookie.<br /><br />There are six individually wrapped cookies per box.  I like the individual wrapping as it keeps the cookies fresh and aids with portion control.  Per cookie you are looking at:   calories,   of fat,   carbohydrates,   g dietary fiber,   sugar, and   protein.  The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Nutritional facts are displayed on each individual wrapper as well, so nutrition, ingredient and allergy information is accessible even without the box or the internet.<br /><br />For a convenient, cheaper and healthier option, Quaker's cookies are a good choice.  I recommend these cookies.  I hope to try the chocolate almond flavor next!\", 'This is more than just a cookie. It is a guilty pleasure.

I did manage a couple bites and I love the soft, chewy-ness of the cookie. Plus, it provides a good source of fiber, something we don't incorporate enough of in our diets sometimes. I will definitely consider purchasing more of these cookies as a snack for my son!\", 'The soft baked cookies are amazingly delicious! Even my children really enjoy them!! I was surprised when they all actually ate it because they never eat anything with raisins in it. This was exciting since I now keeps these with me in case the boys need a snack since they would be able to eat one between the four of them.', \"My kids will devour these cookies. They must be super good because believe it or not my kids are picky cookie eaters. I do not like raisins personally so I haven't tried them myself. My only negative thing I can think of is that they are very crumby because they are soft, so with kids it gets quite messy.\", \"Quaker, which knows a thing or two about oats, has put together a pretty nice oatmeal cookie here. The cookie is soft, as advertised, but is NOT pillowy, doughy, gooey or some other displeasing variety of soft. Rather, it just has a nice yielding softness. No doubt related to the consistency, the cookie is not cloyingly sweet. Oh, it's still definitely a cookie - but you're not overwhelmed with a sugar rush. The raisins didn't add a lot of flavor - the ones I encountered weren't large or anything remotely like plump.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like a relatively low-guilt addition to a lunchbox or a desk drawer for snack time. Tasty, soft, and full of oatmealy goodness.\", 'After trying these cookies for the first time, i am hooked and dont feel guilty because they are delicious. Thanks Quaker for another awesome product.', 'In one box you get six cookies, each individually wrapped.  Which is all meant to be quite convenient, I suppose.  Throw one in your child\\'s lunchbox and send him/her off.  Frankly, these cookies are not nearly as delicious as the ones my husband and I make and ours are lower in fat and calories, with fewer additives.  In other words, healthier.<br /><br />But \"healthier\" isn\\'t why most people buy pre-made food products and these cookies taste good enough.

(Of course, it\\'s hard to eat just the one when there are two in the package so you\\'d have to share.)<br /><br />I know that it\\'s hard to find time to bake from scratch sometimes but the effort to do so, teaching a child how to measure and mix a recipe from scratch, to then enjoy something that the two (or three or four) of you made together, is invaluable.  Make a double batch and freeze the dough before baking and you wouldn\\'t have to do this every week to have enough cookies to last entire month or longer.  You\\'ll build bonding moments, create less waste, teach simple mathematics and cooking skills, and provide a far healthier snack option for your child(ren).<br /><br />And if you truly don\\'t have the time to bake cookies, then buy some fresh fruit.

We have enjoyed these cookies and look forward to more flavors.', 'Generally, these Quaker oatmeal cookies were a disappointment.  The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are   calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around   inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only \"fortifications\" to the cookie are calcium ( %) and iron ( %).', 'These cookies are alright, except that once you are finished you may notice an aftertaste and I think this is due to the cookies containing too much allspice.  The cookies also contain cinnamon, which does not leave an aftertaste.', \"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie was given to me to sample through Influenster Mom Vox box program.  It tasted like it was home baked.  I did notice it was a little heavy in the cinnamon department, so if you don't like cinnamon or if you have an allergy to it, then this would not be a good cookie for you.  This was shared with my   year old daughter that gave her seal of approval, too.\", 'Quaker Cookies for me is that one in the package is suffice for me with a cup of tea or hot cocoa.

So I'll give my review based on how well she liked it. The cookie was extremely fresh when I opened it. My daughter ate about half of the cookie before putting the pack down. So I'll take that as she was somewhat satisfied because if she doesn't like it, she throws it aways and if she really likes it she'll eat it all! Ha! I am interested in finding out what other types of cookies are available because it is a more healthier alternative versus her eating chips or candy.<br /><br />**NOTE: In my review, I only took into account my thoughts on the cookie itself.

So, I am always on the lookout for a good cookie...especially if they are made by someone other than me.  When I got the chance to sample Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins, I said \"Why not?\"  The cookies come   to a box and are individually wrapped.  They are pleasant soft oatmeal with a balanced blend of spices and raisins.  I would have liked more raisins.  They were also very soft almost, as another reviewer mentioned...powdery.  They did have a good taste and they are very convenient (good for lunches, tucked in a backpack or desk drawer) and I found them very filling/satisfying.  But, for me, they were just a bit off mark.  I guess I expected a soft oatmeal cookie to be a bit more solid and chewy.  I will buy them occasionally if I have a specific need for something quick and easy.', \"I was pleasently surprised about how soft this cookie was.  It had great flavor, I couldnt even tell there were raisins in the cookie, which is great because I dont normally like raisins.

I don't cookies in the house, but this one can stay all wrapped and waiting for the perfect moment\", 'QUAKER SOFT BAKED OATMEAL COOKIES RAISINS is a product consisting of a box of six cookies.  Each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope, with a tooth-edge at the top and bottom, suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope.  On the plus side, all of the cookies were intact, despite shipping.  The intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft (not crunchy) and secondarily due to the secure packaging.  The cookies were bland and unadventuresome, both in taste and in texture.  Although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout   whole raisins, it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside.  Therefore, the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump, juicy raisins.  In paying attention to the flavor, I noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor.  Also on the plus side, in knowing (from first-hand experience) that hard oatmeal can get wedged in between fillings, resulting in damage to teeth and fillings, the older consumer will be pleased that this QUAKER product is totally inocuous, as far as dental work is concerned.  These cookies are, indeed, sooooooft!<br /><br />Ordinary oatmeal has about   grams carbohydrate,   grams protein, and   grams fat, per   grams of oatmeal (Pomeranz ( ) Modern Cereal Science and Technology (pages  - )).  The NUTRITION FACTS label that this QUAKER product shows that the breakdown is as follows.  Each QUAKER cookie (  grams) contains   grams carbohydrate,   grams of fat, and only   grams of protein.  Hence, it can be seen, that the cookies, as compared to straight oatmeal, is somewhat low in protein.  The low protein content should not be a concern to most adults, because growth, and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth, is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation, and for growing children.  If any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product, is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings, and need to worry about dental damage.  Although this cookie is fine for children, please remember that much better sources of protein are available, e.g., milk, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, tofu, and legumes (peas, beans, lentils).', 'I love homemade oatmeal raisin cookies, the kind that are a little chewy, made with lots of oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and not too many raisins.  So I was skeptical of this soft, \"store bought\" cookie.  I assumed it would be, well, bad.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It\\'s made with whole grains, which imbues each cookie with  % of daily fiber recommendations.  It was indeed soft, but it didn\\'t seem artificially so, more like it was just cooled down from the oven.<br /><br />As I began my \\'taste test\\', I appreciated the fact that the cookies are individually wrapped, which allows for easy transport in lunches or purses.  I took a small bite at first, because I was already prepared to be disappointed.  As that bite went down, I reached for another.  Then another.  Very tasty, as it turned out!  Soon the cookie was gone and I realized I wanted another one!  However, at   calories each, these are NOT \"low calorie\", they\\'re just made with better ingredients than most.<br /><br />As for other nutrition information (other than the fiber and calorie count mentioned above), each cookie has   milligrams of sodium, so not too bad there.  You\\'ll find  % of calcium and  % of iron (recommended daily requirements).<br /><br />The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Sugar is about number   or so on the ingredient list.  One quibble I have is that the list of ingredients is rather lengthy.  My nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists, probably means there\\'s lots of stuff in there that\\'s not exactly \"good\" for us, but it is what it is:  a factory-made, store-bought cookie that\\'s got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that don\\'t come naturally to \"homemade cookies\".  Just accept it for what it is, a decent, convenient mass-produced cookie.', 'The folks at Quaker really got the soft texture here, and the individual packages keep the cookies very soft and fresh.<br /><br />I would have liked more raisins, I couldn\\'t hear \"it thru the grapevine\".<br /><br />Good nutrition for a cookie.', 'Taste: I thought these did a good job of mimicking the taste of home made cookies. Cinnamony and raisiny (though the raisins aren\\'t big plump raisins...they\\'re more suggestions of raisins...and they are sweetened by sugar and fructose NOT HFCS.<br /><br />Mouth feel: When Mom makes oatmeal cookies, you can feel the oat meal (usually) when you are chewing. This doesn\\'t have that. The oats are milled to the point where the flavour is there but the texture is not. If this is a problem for you, you might want to pass. Other than that, it\\'s probably a good idea to have a glass of milk handy. They are \"moist\" in that they aren\\'t crunchy...but they verge on dry.<br /><br />Value: On Amazon, the cookies come to about . $ a piece. Which is comparable to my local grocery.<br /><br />A good all around (large) cookie and I think I will try the other varieties...you should too!', 'The box says, \"soft baked oatmeal cookies\" and that is exactly what you get!  The cookies are individually packed, which makes it easy to grab for lunches, or to throw in a purse or backback for \"on the go\" kids.  The cookies are fairly good sized, and packed with raisins.  I was concerned about an aftertaste that I have sometimes noticed with cookies that are pre-packaged (maybe a preservative that is often used?) but I did not notice any funny taste or smell to these cookies.  In fact, I could not find anything I was unhappy with!', \"Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite. Quaker Oats has done these well with this new product. The strongest flavor to come off is, perhaps surprisingly, cinnamon. It's a very strong taste at the tip of your tongue. The cookie also does have enough raisins for it to qualify as oatmeal raisin, which was something I was concerned about at first.<br /><br />The cookie is very soft and still tastes pretty fresh, even after all the packing and processing that obviously went into it. They're about as big as you'd imagine it to be from the picture on the box, which is actually impressive given how often cookies end up being smaller than they appear. Overall, this is a good choice if you want cheap, store-bought oatmeal cookies.\", 'This oatmeal cookie was delicious - soft, full of raisins and not too sweet or sugary.  Full of whole grain, I feel confident eating this cookie and giving it to my family to eat as well.  Great item to have in the bag for a quick snack that feels like a treat and is filling too!  Thanks to Quaker and Influenster for introducing me to this product!', \"Quick breakdown of the cost.  For $ .  you got   boxes of   cookies.  That's about $ .  a box, and   cents per cookie.  NOT too bad.<br /><br />Taste-This is a denser cookie than I usually enjoy, especially when it comes to my oatmeal raisin.  (My favorite cookie, by the way!)  It almost has a cake like consistency, and while it isn't the type of cookie I would munch on at home while I watch a Blu-Ray, this is the type of snack I would buy for road trips or picnics.  There is a hint of brown sugar, not overwhelming, but enough that my little ones (  and  ) remarked that they liked the sweetness of it.  My oldest, wished there were more raisins, and I would have to agree with that as well.  But I liked the whole grains. Overall, it is good, but a bit dry.<br /><br />Size-this is a larger cookie, similar to what you would get in say Subway or Starbucks.  Not overly huge, but not too small either.  I think this is a perfect snack size.<br /><br />Nutrition-at   calories it isn't a lightweight, but nor is it overly fattening either.    Grams of fat,  .  grams of Saturated (NOT horrific), but it has some Polyunsaturated and  .  grams of Monounsaturated=the 'good' kind of fat.    grams of fiber, good in a snack like this, but only   grams a protein, wish there was more.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't a snack I would buy on a regular basis.  Maybe once in awhile for school lunches, and I would certainly get this for a road trip, or a hike.

As a quick snack, when you don't have time for a meal, or a super simple quickie breakfast; these are a very good option.  I highly recommend them.\", \"My cookie-hound husband was into them almost before they were out of the mailbox.  The quality and taste are very much the same as Archway brand; that is a good thing as I consider them to be the best store-bought cookie out there.  My husband would have liked more whole oats in the mix, but understands that too few people appreciate texture in their food.<br /><br />The individual wrapping might be nice for kids' lunches but is an expensive and unecological waste for the (typical) case that a group will be eating them and/or individuals will eat more than one.  At the very, very, least wrap them two-at-a time?<br /><br />If they're priced similarly to Archway, I would expect them to do at least as well as the equivalent Archway cookies.\", \"These individually sealed oatmeal raisin cookies are tasty, and soft, but a bit dry. They need to be a little more moist, especially since the whole point of cookies in individual foil wrappers is to protect moisture. The taste is traditional cinnamon raisin, and the taste is fine, but in this crowded market, with many competitors, Quaker cannot afford for the cookies not to be perfectly moist.<br /><br />I remember back when the Quaker Oats came in a round, cardboard container. On the side of that container was a recipe for oatmeal cookies, which my mom used to make frequently. Those cookies, with Nestle's chocolate chips added, were the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I ever tasted. Now, if Quaker could market those cookies and make 'em taste as good as mom's, then they'd have something.\", \"They're cookies so they're not just terrible, but I've had lots better soft-baked cookies than these.  They are pretty bland, just a mild raisiny sweetness and the texture is dry and crumbly and turns a little mealy upon chewing.  I tried them in coffee and in milk to see if they were better that way and while the taste was a little better the texture just became wet and mealy and bits fell off into my coffee.  A soft cookie can definitely be moist, hold up to milk and have a bit of chew to it.  Pepperidge Farm makes an addictive soft baked oatmeal cookie.\", \"One star for being soft. One for having oatmeal. One for having raisins. But that's it. These cookies taste fine, but they are pretty dry and fairly crumbly. Not overly enjoyable. They'd be fine dunked in milk or something, but I'd be afraid half of it would fall into the glass. Little Debbie and Pepperidge Farms have both proven that you can sell packaged, soft-baked cookies that are still moist. Plus, these seem over-packaged. Individually wrapped cookies? Okay, yeah it's handy for a packed lunch or something, but really? That seems excessive. I'd probably skip these.\", 'This is a great product. Moist flavorful cookie that is packaged nicely so you can take it on the go. This is a great to go breakfast or a snack anytime of the day.', 'Tasty cookie!  It was soft, though maybe just a little dry.  The raisins were actually nice and juicy, not all dried up like in most packaged cookies.  Pretty good overall.', 'This cookie is big enough to share! I love the taste this cookie is more on the dry side not so much chewy so if you like the harder drier cookies this is for you!', \"I received this product free to test from Influenster.com and couldnt have been more excited to try.  I love soft baked cookies, but I find that whenever i try to buy ones that are already made, they don't taste fresh.  The Quaker Soft Baked Cookie is large and fulfilling.  The taste was fresh as though it had been made right in your own kitchen.  My kids loved the oatmeal raisin and it had just the right amount of raisins in it.

Taking that first bite brought me right back to my childhood where my mom would bake oatmeal cookies for my grade school parties.  The Quaker cookie is very soft and has just the right amount of raisins.  The raisins do not take away from the taste of the oatmeal.

I was impressed with the fact that they're moderately healthy and liked that they weren't too sweet.<br />The cookies are a bit expensive, and I'd prefer to make my own to have more control over the ingredients, but they are a good shopping choice.

I'm already a huge fan of almost all Quaker products, and these cookies didn't disappoint. They're SUPER soft, and weren't dry whatsoever!!! The oatmeal cookie part has a great flavor, no weird aftertaste like some cookies do. The raisins were decent, nice and plump, juicy, didn't have the dried out look, and there were enough of them in the cookies, but not too many (meaning the kids will still eat them, lol).

My   month old son loved the cookie.  Would love to have these in the house at all times.  Such a healthier way to enjoy cookies.', 'i love this cookies so does my family bought more this week when we went to the store i plan to keep this all the time they are a great snack', 'Let\\'s be honest: there are few desserts that can compete with a fresh baked, chewy oatmeal cookie. Even better when it\\'s oatmeal raisin! As such, I was somewhat skeptical of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies, as I\\'m generally let down by store-bought cookies. Well, I\\'m here to tell you, I have become a believer. I have seen the light! Here\\'s a breakdown of what I think overall:<br /><br />TEXTURE:<br />The package says \"soft-baked,\" and brother, it is no lie. These cookies are soft, moist and chewy, thus negating the need to do the milk dunk. Though, ice cold milk is a requisite with cookies, regardless.<br /><br />SERVING SIZE:<br />At  , these cookies are pretty well-sized and will definitely satisfy even the hardiest of sugar seekers. It would take   Oreos to match the size of one oatmeal raisin. No contest.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />Dynamite. Sweet cinnamon and raisins definitely prevail in this recipe, giving the oatmeal an authentic, homemade flavor.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL PROFILE:<br />Now, this is where Quaker loses a few points with me. Though certainly not the unhealthiest cookie out there (in fact, it\\'s probably on the healthier end of the spectrum), there are a few select ingredients that could be avoided, such as corn syrup. But, each cookie does contain   of fiber, as well as several grams of healthy fats, and   protein! For those who are curious, here\\'s the complete nutrient breakdown:<br /><br />Serving Size:   Cookie ( )<br />Calories:  <br />Total Fat:   ( %)<br />Saturated Fat:  .  ( %)<br />Polyunsaturated Fat:  <br />Monounsaturated Fat:  . <br />Cholesterol:   ( %)<br />Sodium:   ( %)<br />Total Carbohydrate:   ( %)<br />Dietary Fiber:   ( %)<br />Sugars:  <br />Other Carbohydrate:  <br />Protein:  <br /><br />Ingredients: Whole Grain Oat Flour, Enriched Flour (Bleached and Unbleached Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Raisins, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Whole Wheat Flour, Palm and High Oleic Canola Oil (with TBHQ [preservative]), Fructose, Invert Sugar Syrup, Mid-Oleic Sunflower Oil, Raisin Paste, Inulin, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil*, Honey, Brown Sugar Molasses), Dried Eggs, Modified Corn Starch, Corn Syrup, Polydextrose, Leavening Agents (Sodium Bicarbonate, Ammonium Bicarbonate), Oat Fiber, Propylene Glycol Mono- and Diesters of Fat and Fatty Acids, Mono- and Diglycerides, Soy Lecithin, BHT [to preserve freshness], Citric Acid [to preserve freshness], Wheat Gluten, Molasses, Calcium Phosphate, Salt, Natural Flavor, Cinnamon, Allspice, Corn Starch, Enzymes. *Adds a Dietarily Insignificant Amount of Trans Fat<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />Stellar! Each cookie is individually wrapped for easy travel and consumption, so parents can toss one in their kid\\'s lunch box, or tote one to the office for an easy snack/dessert.<br /><br />COST:<br />From what I can tell, the Quaker cookies are about par for the course in terms of cost, neither on the high nor low end, making for a pretty economical choice. Based on Amazon\\'s pricing as I write this, the cost is slightly less than $ .  per cookie. Not bad!<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If you\\'re looking to indulge in something sweet, somewhat healthy, and reminds you of a homemade treat, you can\\'t do much better than Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies. The only challenge will be trying to resist a second helping, especially if you still have ice cold milk remaining in your glass.', \"My box has an expiration date of September  ,  , which is a little bit less than   months (which is okay, because the cookies get eaten up fast!). The cookies, made with whole grain Quaker oats, are definitely soft baked, and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite! My only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins, I couldn't taste them! It was practically just an oatmeal taste.<br /><br />Each cookie's size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand. I love that they are individually wrapped because it means I can take them on the go with me! Each cookie is   calories, has  .  gram of fat,   of sodium, and   of sugar. I don't recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high. This is good as treats for children's lunches though or to have them in your car when ever you go hungry.<br /><br />Also, I dropped one of the cookies (still in the wrapper) on the floor and it did not crumble, which I was happy with.\", 'This is a must have for those sweet tooth cravings. My youngest child is   and isn\\'t much of a sweets eater. However, he found the sample I received from Influenster and he LOVED it!

They were so soft and tasted just like homemade.  It is exactly what I expected from Quaker!\", 'Three years ago I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. It sucked. There\\'s nothing like bring in the middle of the ravenousness of pregnancy and being told to watch what you eat. But it did get me to start paying better attention to how I could still enjoy foods I loved while making healthier choices. One of the things I learned to balance was fiber intake. Ever since I\\'ve made a point to always go for whole grains when the choice is available and Quaker\\'s products tend to make the best of combining deliciousness with heart-healthy oats.<br /><br />I recently received a sample of these Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster and they\\'re surprisingly good. Maybe not quite as good as the ones my mom made when I was a kid but still a tasty treat reminiscent of the childhood classic.

Most oatmeal cookies leave a thick,dry feeling in your mouth but nothing like that with this one, perhaps because it was so soft and chewy. They are on my list to buy again.

Well they have been trying to expand from just the basic oatmeal for some time. These soft cookies are tasty and satisfying. In my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear. Weel - they disappeared in swift order. In fact I barely got to taste more than one. The general consensus is these are 'just like homemade. There is not greater compliment that can be paid. They are packaged conveniently for inclusion in school lunches etc. They certainly make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee for that unwinding moment all of us need at somour day.\", 'These cookies are much closer to homemade than most of those break-and-bake cookies out there, with similar nutritional info. Very soft, with lots of plump raisins, great on the go!', \"I like oatmeal and raisin cookies but I don't eat them very often.  That's probably because my wife makes such awesome chocolate cookies.  When I do get an opportunity to try an oatmeal and raisin cookie it is usually from a store-bought package.  I usually come away impressed with how moist these pre-packaged cookies are.  That's what surprised me most about Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie;  They're soft but they aren't moist.  There is a distinct soft dryness to the cookies. The taste was good and my grand daughter quickly ate up most of them.  She liked them because they are tasty and soft.

Maybe it was the baking process?<br /><br />These cookies, although individually packed (so good for school lunches), came out a bit dry and crumbly.<br /><br />Sure, maybe I am just a messy eater but a soft baked cookie just not crumble as much as the cookies I got crumbled.<br /><br />Maybe if you get them at the supermarket they would be less dry.<br /><br />Maybe if is just a general problem with the way they are produced.', \"These cookies come individually wrapped and easy to stash in lunch boxes, picnic baskets, or give to the kids as an after school snack. However, I did not find them to be the most appetizing thing in the world - especially as an adult who is used to low cal or sugar free snacks. Kids hate them. I couldn't get mine to try more than one bite. Even as an oatmeal cookie, they aren't that good. We found them salty and bland. Yes they were soft, but also crumbly, which made a mess. I wouldn't say they are the worst I've ever tried, be definitely not as good as other Quaker products.\", \"I really liked these cookies. They are sort of firm but not crunchy, so they don't get crumbs everywhere. They worked really well for me as a post breakfast snack (or sadly even breakfast on some days).

I recommend this to all cookie lovers, especially those fond of oatmeal raisin.', 'These large cookies greatly resemble in look and taste the ones you might get in a vending machine.  They are individually packaged and have a soft and chewy texture.

Over all the flavor was fabulous with just the right amount of raisins, but I found it to be toooo soft. I do like soft cookies but I had a hard time eating this cookie because it was so soft it crumbled in my fingertips as I tried to take bites so I had to eat it over the wrapper carefully.

My expectations were high.<br /><br />This is a good cookie, but not a great one, so I was a little disappointed.  The consistency is excellent, just what you would want from a soft baked cookie.  And it is defintely enough for a snack - at  .  oz and   calories - that's plenty. The raisins, too were outstanding. But the cookie itself was not great tasting. I wanted bigger hunks of oatmeal-- more texture, and there was an aftertaste of the preservatives.\", 'The Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade.  They are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt (which is exactly how I like my cookies).  And even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  And there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.  On the flip side, the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that I cannot pronounce (is a red flag for me).', \"Nice flavor, and only   calories per cookie; the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are tasty.  But they're just not something to get overly excited about.  If oatmeal cookies are your definition of snacking nirvana, you might find these well worth trying.\", 'These cookies were a hit with everyone in our family from the oldest ( ) to the youngest (  months.)  The cookies were very soft and tasty.  Each cookie was full of raisins, and still retained an \"oatmeal\" taste.  They are sized perfectly, one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box.  My only complaint is that they were crumbly.  This was fine for my   month old twins, as they still don\\'t have all of their teeth, and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies.  I had a problem with the crumbly texture, because when I tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk, a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass, where it turned into inedible mush.  Aside from that one complaint, I have nothing bad to say about these yummy cookies.', \"These are delicious, no question. They seem to have achieve the perfect level of sweetness, unlike most cookies with are a lot more sugary tasting. Kudos.<br /><br />There are also plenty of raisins, so at least part of its sweetness comes from a more natural source.<br /><br />My only complaint is the cookies were surprisingly dry. They are very well packaged, so I don't think that was the problem. Maybe they're made that way. But I've also heard that some products aren't great to order by mail in hot summer months, as they may dry out. I know mine probably spent at least a few hours on the porch in   degree weather. Dunking the cookie in tea or milk, or microwaving them for   seconds helped a lot.<br /><br />Otherwise, these were yummy and seem more healthy than other choices.\", \"These cookies are pretty good.  They are soft and flavorful.  They are not amazing or as good as homemade, but what packaged cookie is?  These are better than other packaged cookies we've tried, and the nutrition information isn't horrible either.\", 'These cookies are soft, but not crumbly like so many mass-produced \"soft\" cookies.  They have a good amount of raisins and slight oatmeal-spice flavor.  A plus is the individual wrappings, good for taking on an outing, packing in school lunches or even selling at a bake sale.  Don\\'t expect the same chewiness or intensity of oat flavor as bakery or homemade cookies, but as store shelf cookies go, I\\'ve had worse (Chips Ahoy \"chewy gooey\" for instance).', 'These are pretty tasteless, and the texture is all wrong.<br /><br />An oatmeal cookie should have a good texture, you should bite into something a little crunchy.  While I understand these are \"soft-baked\", I still expected to have some differentiation between the outer edges and the inside of the cookie.  There was none. They just don\\'t taste that good.<br /><br />I ate one, my husband ate one, and the rest are still sitting in a box on the counter.', 'I did not love the taste or texture of this cookie. It is somehow simultaneously soft and dry  and gritty. The taste is nothing remarkable. And, it is not particularly healthy- not bad, but the stats arent great for one small-ish cookie.<br /><br />Give it a try, you may like it, but I was disappointed. I recommend Bel Vita Biscuits as a healthier- and tastier- cookie alternative.', \"For a product like this, it's pretty good. Soft, tasty, seemed fresh. They didn't last long at my house.

I took a bite and gave the rest to my son, which was gone before I even had a chance to change my mind. LOL One of the moistest, most delicious cookies I have ever had, hands down. The only drawback that I found was that my cookies was broken into about   pieces, not sure what happened, but that doesn't effect the flavor!\", 'These cookies are so good. They taste homemade!

Annette G', 'I know they say \"soft baked\" but how often is a packaged cookie really all that soft? Well, these are super soft!  The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was that the cookie was so soft and moist that it broke apart with little to no effort.  I shared the cookie with my preschool daughter.  We both loved the taste.  I\\'m not usually an oatmeal cookie fan, but I really liked this cookie.  My daughter asked me to buy her more of them.  That in itself makes it a winner, ha!

I had to buy another box right away.\", 'they are great, tasty and delicisous.  We even tried the banana nut ones, they were fantastic we loved them.  My kids loved them a great breakfast on the go...', 'The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, is a great tasting snack that gives you that full feeling. Just   of these cookies gives you that satisfying full feeling. Since it is made out of oatmeal and raisins, we could classify it as a healthy snack. But on the nutritional breakdown, would be better if this snack would go down on a less than   cholesterol. The per serving content of cholesterol is  , sugar is  , so as with any other food, moderation is the key. Nevertheless, anything oatmeal gives you a great start on eating, whether to maintain a healthy lifestyle or starting one.', \"Chewy, sweet goodness. These cookies are right up my alley. I even liked that they were individually packaged--great for lunch boxes or for keeping cookie monsters from devouring the entire package in one sitting. The individual cookies weren't huge but they were big and chewy enough to satisfy a sweet tooth with just one package. They weren't overly sweet or overloaded with raisins--someone must have studied the cookie-to-raisin ratio and came up with the perfect number. I'll definitely much on these again.\", 'This is an interesting product - the texture is immediately attractive and quite remarkable given that it is a packaged product, but the flavor is not quite right. There is a sense of artificiality about the flavor that may come from preservatives or flavoring additives. My family ate all the samples we received, but there was no real drive to go out and buy a box, even among my otherwise enthusiastic cookie-eating teens.  I think that the product needs a trip back to the drawing board if the goal is authentic oatmeal cookie taste and not just texture.  Sorry!', \"As a lover of oatmeal cookies since the days of being a kid, I was anxious to try these from such a well known brand.  I have always been someone that sticks to either cheaper brands, or the kind of cookies that are made in a markets own bakery.  Personally I think the latter are the best there is in most cases as far as store bought is concerned..  As for these Quaker cookies I found them to be just average in taste.  The box I got held very fresh cookies individually wrapped that were satisfying in flavor, but not at all anything special.  Personally I don't think the heavier cost of these are worth it for just being a famous brand.  You can do at least just as good with other store bought brands, and much better in my opinion in buying your local markets cookies.  On the other hand if you happen to be a big fan Quaker Oats cookies, or just enjoy the particular flavor of these, buying them here in the big   pack is not a bad deal at all.  The cost is enough to get you the free shipping, and the convenience along with the reasonable price makes it a sold deal.  Enjoy if these are your favor.. : )\", \"Quaker soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins taste pretty darn good. The only draw back are they're too dry. Still, much better than many other similar cookies made by other companies, some who make their products even drier and why sweeter. Still, with a cup of tea or coffee they make a pretty good snack or bit of an after dinner treat. I was disappointed when I reached into the box for a cookie after lunch and realized I'd already eaten them all!\", \"I'm always on the look-out for a good tasting, individually wrapped, healthy snack that I can toss in my bag for a quick bite. Oatmeal cookies are one of my favorites so I gave these a try.<br /><br />The packaging is fine but the cookie does not have a very good taste. It has a dry texture to it, not very oat-like at all. They are soft, but not moist. There were plenty of raisens but not enough spice for my taste. On the positive side, they do contain more fiber than most cookies, but at   calories each, they are a little fattening.\", 'I tried one: gave it two bites (to be sure) and then into the trash. Not even close to appetizing. It\\'s amazing, how can something be chewy and yet powdery dry and quite tasteless simultaneously? Quaker\\'s R&D figured out the conundrum and produced these \"cookies\". I assume it\\'s the oat bran since I had similar experiences with using it when it was THE thing to do (e.g., pancakes). However, what ever it is, it ain\\'t good! I do not recommend these, not even to my sworn enemies!', \"This is a pretty good cookie in terms of taste / flavor, but as cookies go I will say it was a little dry with the actual cookie part and not as moist as I like with oatmeal cookies (the raisins were moist).  Each cookie is individually wrapped vs. opening up a whole box which makes for a good snack to take the edge off of your day.<br /><br />Each cookie is   calories with   grams of fat ( % of recommended daily value) and   grams of dietary fiber ( % of the recommended daily value), so I really don't want to eat more than one a day!\", 'First of all, I like that the cookies are individually wrapped. I can grab one and stick it in my pocket on my way out the door in the morning.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are big and a good thickness. They are soft with out being crumbly. The promised raisins are mostly small bits of chopped raisins and don\\'t really add to the flavor of the cookie. I would have like whole raisins. The taste is mostly oatmeal with just the right amount of cinnamon. They are also dry. You really need an accompanying beverage with these. They are hearty enough that one makes a good snack.<br /><br />While I would never mistake these for Mom\\'s oatmeal cookies (or mine for that matter) they\\'re not too bad for \"store-bought.\" If you like oatmeal cookies, give these a try. Just have a drink ready, too.', \"I am kind of shocked that these cookies were too sweet since I have really enjoyed how Quaker can make food be sweet but not too sweet. These are all individually wrapped, which is easy for on the go and keeps the cookies extra fresh. Each cookie is a decent size and we ate these over a week and it kept its softness.<br /><br />For me, it was a bit too sweet and I am a big sweet eater. I actually don't taste the oatmeal as much and more of the raisins, which could be why it was just so sweet to me.<br /><br />It was still yummy and I would get it again but only if I am in a really sweet mood.\", 'I loved these cookies! My daughter eat them right up. They are soft and taste great. I like softer cookies and this one was a hit with my whole family.', 'Chock full of sugar!  Absolutely not something I would serve to my family.  Obviously, all cookies have sugar in them, but these seem to be a bit excessive.', 'I recently received the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie as a part of my Mom VoxBox from Influenster.  I was a little apprehensive giving the cookie to my own two \"cookie monsters\" because they have not been big raisin fans, but they LOVED it!  The texture is so soft and chewy that they gobbled it up and asked for more!  They never even noticed the raisins!  I will buy these again as a special treat for them :)', \"I got these in the Mom VoxBox from Influenster, and was excited to try them!<br />They are chewy and delish!

Love the homestyle taste of the cookie and that it is very nutrious! Definetly gotta get some more!', 'Well, let me start by saying these cookies are very soft and moist. However, I did not really like them. They were not sweet (which is a matter of personal preference) and they had a gritty texture to them.', 'These cookies are delicious. They are full of flavor and taste moist and fresh. My kids loved them!!! My expectations were exceeded!', 'This cookie is one of the best cookies that i have tried in a while since i do not like the hard crunchy ones like chips ahoy because it is so soft to the bite and pulls you in to make you want more. You can taste all the ingredents none are hidden and has a good amount of raisins in the cookie. I will be buying these for my family as long as they make them.', \"Quaker Soft Baked cookie taste homemade, I like that is made with whole grains, low calorie & just healthy yummy goodness that everyone in the family can enjoy.

It was very good to me, not too sweet and not oily tasting like some package cookies. The fact that it is made with whole grain oats made it even better.  I am going to buy the cranberry & yogurt next.', 'I love the home baked mom taste these have! Just like my mom made them! They are also easy to find and affordable!', \"I rec'd this product from influenster and Quaker for testing purposes. I've always enjoyed Quaker oats from the hot oatmeal, down to the cookie itself. Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie is made with whole grain Quaker oats, At least   grams of whole grains per serving.<br />Made with real fruit, Good source of fiber, delicious. Quaker oats been around since over a hundred years.\", 'I received one of these awesome cookies from Influenster! They are DELICIOUS!! Super soft and moist...tasted home made! :) Yummy!', \"These cookies are a great cookie. I love oatmeal cookies but the only thing I didn't like was the raisins. This is only because I hate raisins. So if you like raisins then you would probably like them. I probably wouldn't repurchase this for myself because I would rather make homemade without them. I would repurchase it for my boyfriend though because he loves raisins.\", \"Soft, chewy and just like Grandma used to make. I can't wait until I eat the next cookie as these are something to savor and enjoy!\", 'From Influenster I received the Quaker Soft Baked Cookie. With this product, after dinner one night, I divided it up into   equal portions. One for myself, one for my husband, and another for our    /  year old daughter.<br />Our daughter devoured the cookie before I even sat back down and was asking for more. She absolutely loved it. My husband and I, on the other hand, were not impressed. We were expecting something a little more. The cookie itself was a little dry and there was something about the taste that was off a little bit.<br /><br />I do not think we will be buying this product in our home in the future. But I am pleasantly pleased with the chance to try it first.', 'My whole family absolutely loves these cookies...so soft and yummy!  And I like the fact that they are a nutritious treat for the kids...a much better option than candy or soda.', 'I loved how soft and delicious these cookies are!

Iwll be back to buy mor of them for sure thanks to the wonderful ingredients from Quaker I can't wait to try out the different varieties that Quaker carries! A fan for life I am!!Thanks Quaker!! Thanks to Influenster for giving me the chance to try these cookies in my Vox Box!

Not to mention cheap, I'll be buying more.\", 'I really enjoyed the goodness of Quaker Oatmeal combined with soft, plump and juicy raisins in a soft cookie. It is an irrisistable snack for the entire family and leaves you feeling full and satisfied.', 'These cookies are so delicious.. I received one in my influenster mom voxbox and just had to repurchase.. So soft and chewy..def a must buy..happy customer over here..good job quaker', 'I received one of these cookies in my Influenster Mom VoxBox, these cookies, are really good and soft and chewy! I really enjoyed it! It tasted fresh, and not at all like a packaged cookie, I was also impressed at how well it held together during shipping, it was not crumbly like other cookies that have arrived in the mail.', 'These individually wrapped cookies taste fairly good. A little on the bland side, but the good side of the bland side, if there is such a thing. They are a nice sized cookie...bigger than other packaged cookies that come in the plastic trays. They have the perfect amount of raisins in them - not over packed, but just enough. I guess I expected them to be more \"oatmealy\" since they are from Quaker, after all. They have the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor going on, but not the texture.<br /><br />The complaint that I have with them is that they are SO very dry. You will definitely want to have a big glass of milk handy. That itself was another problem for me - I don\\'t drink milk. I just don\\'t like it. Yes, it is a personal problem, not a fault of Quaker of course, but what else do you drink with cookies? Nothing else seems to go quite right with cookies. I do like to dunk cookies in milk, but these Oatmeal Raisin cookies are not a good choice for that because they would get mushy and fall apart right away.<br /><br />I can\\'t say that i\\'d buy these. Much too dry for me and not enough flavor to make up for it.', \"Came as an  -pack, individually wrapped.  Bottom line- they're awesome!  Soft, chewy, about  /  inch thick and full of oatmeal-raisiny goodness, you can't go wrong with these!  Soooo good!\", \"Look, it's simple.  You want a good oatmeal raisin cookie, you bake them yourself or go to a bakery.  Stuff you get out of a box like this will never come close.  That said, for what this is, it's not bad.  At   in the morning when you're having a cookie emergency, they'll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  But don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.<br /><br />I can't really recommend them, but I can't entirely dismiss them either.  Consider them stop-gap and buy accordingly.\", \"Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite type of cookie. My grandma makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies and a lady at church makes the second best. However, I'm always willing to try someone else's oatmeal raisin cookies. Recently, Quaker started selling these SOFT-BAKED OATMEAL COOKIE WITH RAISINS. The cookies themselves aren't too bad. They're better than the usual store-bought oatmeal cookie. They're soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste. However, there's nothing that really distinguishes them either. There are   cookies in a box. They are good cookies that make a nice after lunch dessert or an in between snack.\", \"Who doesn't love oatmeal cookies made with Quaker Oats? I have many fond memories of enjoying making cookies straight out of the Quaker oat box, enjoying them after-school or having them packed in my school lunchbag. When I saw these were available to test, I was naturally excited, I've always loved Quaker oats and they make a quality product. Always.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these cookies to be remarkably bland and quite plain. They aren't sweet enough for my particular taste, nor are they remarkable in any way. Sure they have whole grain. But they taste too bland for me, and are indeed quite plain. No one in my family liked them. They were just completely generic. For me, they needed more cinnamon and sugar and vanilla for my taste preference.<br /><br />There are   individual cookies sealed in tiny packs, making them useful for travel/lunches.\", \"I love oatmeal cookies, so I was really enthused about giving a new brand a try. However, these failed miserably in my mind - each individual cookie has   of sugar, yet there is a dry, bland taste. Combined with the fact that there are   calories,   grams of fat and   mg of sodium in each cookie, it's hardly worth eating if you don't even enjoy the taste!\", \"As promised, these cookies are nice and soft, and they're chewy.  Those are the good points.  The bad points are that they don't have all that much flavor.  They also have a heavier consistency than what I would prefer.  These cookies would benefit from more of the kinds of spices that can make cookies tasty- cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatnot.  I'd be willing to try these in a chocolate chip or other chocolate version, as the chocolate would add some flavor value, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these again.\", \"I hardly noticed the raisins in this cookie, which is great if you don't like raisins, but I do like them.  The oatmeal flavor for the cookie is just as it should be.  When first opening the packet the aroma hinted at maybe a pinch of cinnamon added or maybe nutmeg in the mix.<br /><br />The consistency though was spongy, and rather dry.  I needed something to drink with it to help moisten it up.\", 'I was impressed with the list of ingredients that included whole grain oat and whole grain wheat flour as well as whole grain rolled oats. Most cookies labeled \"oatmeal\" have enriched white flour as their main ingredient.  These cookies also have a generous amount of juicy raisins, not the dried out raisins found in some other brands.<br /><br />I did find the cookies a bit too sweet for my taste, especially on the first bite.  The sweetness was much less strong after that first bite. There is a natural grain aftertaste that I found pleasant but others may not.  Also, I found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened. I found that if I let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking.<br /><br />I liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale.  I also liked that the ingredient list is on each package; this is very important for those with food allergies if the box is not available.<br /><br />All in all though these are a good treat. Very enjoyable.  I would give it  .  stars if that rating were possible.', \"If you're thin & can eat cookies, enjoy yourself.  These come in single packs of mid-sized cookies (.  oz. each), so I suppose it can help with portion control.  However, at   calories, it's pretty high for those needing to lose weight.  It only contains   of protein.  It also contains   of sugar, so I wouldn't call this a friendly treat for those people battling diabetes or who are borderline diabetics.  The ingredients are in very tiny print, in a box that is over  .  inches in length, & contains loads of ingredients I can barely pronounce & have no idea what they are.  It's is kinda soft & tastes okay; but it's not a cookie a foodie like myself gushes over.\", \"I didn't expect a lot from a pre-packaged cookie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin!  It was surprisingly soft and chewy.  I also love that it's a somewhat healthy snack.  It would be even better warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds.  Good job, Quaker :)<br /><br />I received this product complimentary for testing purposes through the Influenster Mom VoxBox.\", \"I received this cookie to test from Influenster.  I had the raisin cookie and it was really so good!  I like that they use whole grains to make the cookie.

The cookie is very soft and the flavor is nice.  It tastes great with a big glass of milk or microwaved for   seconds or so to heat it up.  The individually wrapped cookies make them great to pack in lunches or keep in the car for an afternoon snack.  Truthfully, if they weren\\'t individually wrapped, you could probably eat several in one sitting without even realizing it.<br /><br />Go ahead and plate them up and say you cooked them yourself.

I would recommend these to every one:)', 'I shared these with my toddler. We both loved them. They are soft and practically melt in your mouth. They are so soft and delicious. The fact that they are healthy also helps and makes me feel great about giving them to my kids.', \"As Soon as I received my sample in the Influenster Mom VoxBox from influenster.com my   yr old ate it leaving me only a bite to sample. So I went to Walmart to buy more. All they had were the Apple Cinnamon ones and he ate the entire box! I luckily put up   cookie just in case and that was my cookie. Hubby and him are addicted and I can see why. They taste very fresh and everyone loves them!<br />I got to try this product for free in my MomVoxBox from Influenster.com<br />I'm an Influenster and Influence friends and family and yes, even strangers into trying new and amazing products!\", \"Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins are OK, but they left me wanting something better.  I thought they tasted good, but I found them to be a little on the dry side.  A lot of packaged cookies have an odd chemical aftertaste, but I didn't really notice much with these.<br /><br />However, I would like to see better choices on ingredients.  First, I don't understand the need for both bleached and unbleached flour.  Quaker should just stick with unbleached.  Second, I accept sugar as an ingredient.  These are cookies.  Cookies are sweet, and I expect sugar.  Yet why do they also have to use fructose, invert sugar syrup, corn syrup, and polydextrose?  These also contain molasses, which are a natural sweetener.  Finally, these have both corn starch and modified corn starch.  Again, why?  You may find other ingredients that you would question, but these seemed like the glaring issues to me.  In the end, I think this is too much to overcome when you combine it with a relatively high percentage (  out of  ) of calories from fat.  In short, I cannot recommend these cookies.\", \"I received one box of these cookies from the Amazon Vine program. I had not done any rsearch on them previously but remembered the oatmeal cookies my grandmother baked and how tasty they were. I was anxious to try out the Quaker version. When the box arrived the first thing I noticed, right on the front of the box, was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping   calories. When I was a super active kid I ate my grandmother's cookies with impunity although I did not know the calorie count. I was always a skinny kid regardless of what I ate. Now, as an adult, I am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and I do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies. However, I wanted to do a taste test so I took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies. They have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count. Dry, stale and tasteless are the best descriptions I can come up with.\", \"I received a box of these cookies through the Amazon Vine program, and I am not impressed.  I had rather high expectations since I generally like Quaker products, and my family eats a lot of their chewy granola bars. These cookies are quite disappointing. They are soft, but they are also very dry. The raisins are totally desiccated and not even chewy because they are so dry and shriveled. The cookies themselves have a dry, rather powdery texture. At   calories per cookie, I plan to stick with Quaker's chewy granola bars which taste much better and are in the  -  calorie range.\", \"When it has came down to Quaker, they have really made some great products for snacking along the busy day. From their classic granola bars, to instant oatmeal on the go. But they have decided to step that up again with their soft baked oatmeal cookies. They absolutely taste very good. The feeling of being a simple cookie are worth their while. My only gripes about them is that their only   in a package so if you really are a heavy cookie snacker, you'll be a bit dissapointed. Also, there aren't that many in a package compared to the amount there are in a box from Little Debbie or other brands of cookies. Nevertheless, they are definitely delightful from Quaker, and if you're looking for a alternative to cookies, than this would be a good box to try.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+\", 'I am a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, and enjoy eating them for a snack or dessert. These are very good pre-made soft oatmeal-raisin cookies, and I have really enjoyed eating them. They are soft, chewy and they taste great. They are not too bad when it comes to nutrition either - each one of them is just   calories. The only downside for me about these cookies is that they seem to be a bit too crumbly, and not gooey enough. Each cookie comes in an individual wrapping, so tehy are very convenient to take with you for a snack on a go, and the individual wrapping also helps preserve freshness. Overall, a very good choice for fulfilling your sweet cravings.', \"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins have very good packaging, one relatively sturdy outside box and individually wrapped cookies inside. This is the high point. It goes down hill from there.<br /><br />Let me start with the taste. It is average at best, it is soft, but very cardboardy in taste which makes the sweetness of the raisins stand out even more. Often times with food, the trade-offs are great taste with bad nutrition versus average/bad taste with good nutrition. This one has both average/bad taste and bad nutrition. So what's the point of eating not-very-tasty junk food?<br /><br />Because let's face it, that's what this is. The list of ingredients is unnaturally long -   lines (yes sixteen lines) of ingredients on the box, including fan favorite Corn Syrup. This is just an oatmeal cookie for crying out loud.<br /><br />And here's the bad nutrition:   calories per cookie, including  % cholesterol,   sugars,  % sodium ( ). On the plus side,   of dietary fiber and   of protein. Other numbers from the label:   of fat ( .  saturated),   total carbs, and single digit percentages of iron and calcium. Each cookie weighs around  .  ounces, so this is not a giant cookie.<br /><br />If you are going to eat a cookie, at least eat a cookie you actually like. Otherwise, what's the point?\", \"Let me start off by saying I'm a bit of a cookie snob having lived next door to my grandmother for most of my youth.  There's nothing better than a homemade cookie.  Having tried these and shared them with some co-workers I can honestly say that it's not just me that wasn't impressed.  There wasn't much said that was positive.  For being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry.  It was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie.  There was no yummy buttery taste.  They just weren't worth the   cals per cookie.  The only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks.\", \"I must admit this was one great product. Not only did I enjoy these my son's did as well . They were a big hit today at my sons birthday party and I intend to keep purchasing!! Great job!\", 'I receive a sample of this cookie in  a complimentary box to review from influenster it was delicious I have never tried these but I would recommend them to anyone', '<span class=\"tiny\"> Length::  :  Mins<br /><br /></span>These are very good, not too sweet, not too crumbly, slightly dry, good raisins with low ratio, excellent texture, very natural tasting (nothing artificial), dense & filling enough.  For a store bought cookie, they are very good.  There is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  They taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  Most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  These hold up well.  The raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  They are moderately sized, smaller that I would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  They are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, I thought they were very good.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using Quaker oats and being a good source of fiber.  They do have  % fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry  % of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  Compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  Just don\\'t think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  But if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway.', \"I received Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in Raisin complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.<br /><br />I have an off again on again relationship with oatmeal cookies because some oatmeal cookies have a very gritty texture from the oatmeal. I was pleasantly surprised that the pieces of cookie I tested were not very gritty, and the raisin was delicious. There is NO WAY these were not homemade in some shape or fashion. They are so delicious.<br /><br />With only   grams of fat,  calories, and   of sugar per serving (  cookie) I would consider it a healthier alternative to other cookies on the market. I've already went to the store and purchased another box.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in trying these cookies out!\", 'I loved this cookie!

They did not even complain about the raisins, I think they gobble them up before they even notice!', 'I received a sample of these and quickly went out and purchased a box.

I love the fact that these cookies are not high in sugar like other ones. I went out and bought a box of the apple cinnamon to try and love them as well. My family loves the Quaker brand and will continue to buy and recommend Quaker.\", 'i love these soft cookies. they taste like fresh baked out of the oven. the oatmeal is very sweet and tasty', \"I absolutely loved these new cookies.

Nice to keep around the house for quick meals, toss them in homemade ice cream for a yummy flavor or just grab one when you have a sweet tooth!', '~ Quick Take: Tasty, chewy, soft-baked cookies with oats and raisins that the whole family can enjoy! =)<br />~ Usage Tips: Eat them as a snack, dessert or basically anytime of the day. They go well with a cup of tea or maybe with a cup of coffee in the morning.<br />~ The Verdict: Next time you\\'re at the store, don\\'t leave without picking up some Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies! They are good to take \"on-the-go\" since they are individually packaged. They are a healthy treat, provides a good source of fiber, contains   grams of total fat per serving, and made with whole grain Quaker Oats! You can\\'t beat that! Try them out, I\\'m sure you\\'ll love them as much as I did! =D', \"The cookie didn't make it much further than out of the box. It was big enough to split between my two daughters and it was a HIT with my super-picky eaters. I got a very small bite and loved it. It really did taste like something that could have baked in my own kitchen. I will definitely be buying more of these cookies and maybe next time I will get a whole one.\", \"My kids or I didn't care for it much, they tossed it after a few bites, and what kids throw away cookies????\", \"If I could give it zero stars I would......horrible taste and not much of that either. Like a very hint of molasses that was too old to use. If I had never had an oatmeal raisin cookie before and this was my first taste of one I would never try one again. QUAKER....pull these off the shelves of any store selling them and throw them in the garbage where they belong. This product gives Quaker a bad name. PLEASE.... don't waste your money on these and don't tell your kids they can have one for a treat, they are more like something you would give them for a punishment....\", \"These cookies are soft and delicious.  Possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats, they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie.  Instead they are almost melt-in-your mouth, with nicely soft raisins as well.  Perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie.  I enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn't mind if it was brought more to the forefront.<br /><br />I don't usually buy individually wrapped food, so I don't think I'd buy this product again, but I would certainly recommend it to others.\", \"I cannot say these taste like home made but the are not that far off. I like their chewiness and I am a crispy cookie person.  These are very tasty in fact they are too tasty I wanted to eat them all at once.  I would love to dip these I melted chocolate or make a sandwich cookie out of them by putting some kind of frosting or chocolate in the middle. Oh my would that be great.<br /><br />These are not too sweet they are just right basically in every way.  I like the fact that they come individually wrapped so you can put them in your lunch bag or send them with your children for their noon meal. Each cookie is   calories and that is not bad considering the size of them, they are quit big and should satisfy anyone's urge for a sweet treat.<br />I am very pleased with these cookies and would definitely buy them again.\", 'this cookie is super soft and chewy.i love it and also try their oatmeal cookies,they are the bomb diggitty!!!i would recommend this to everyone.i received this in my mom voxbox and my kids loved it!!', \"These cookies are reasonably tasty without being too sweet. The individual packing keeps them nice and moist and makes it easy to include one in a packed lunch.<br /><br />That said, they are not so special that I'd make an effort to seek them out. Also, the fact that each cookie is   calories would keep me from having them too often. Luckily, the individual packing will keep them fresh till you feel like having one.\", 'THIS IS A FAB PRODUCT SOFT AND CHEWY YOU CANT GO WRONG ME AND MY KIDS LOVE THEM MY TWO YEAR OLD IS HARD FOR HIM TO SHARE HE SAYS NO MY COOKIE LOL', \"I loved these cookies and so did my kids.

that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  my husband and i tried these cookies for dessert last night.  the first issue was that they are   calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around   inches in diameter.  second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  the only \"fortifications\" to the cookie are calcium ( %) and iron ( %).', 'these cookies are alright, except that once you are finished you may notice an aftertaste and i think this is due to the cookies containing too much allspice.  the cookies also contain cinnamon, which does not leave an aftertaste.', \"the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie was given to me to sample through influenster mom vox box program.  it tasted like it was home baked.  i did

review, i only took into account my thoughts on the cookie itself.  but if i had to grade this with the price that amazon has it for, i would probably give it   star!  a  -pack of these cookies is $ .

tucked in a backpack or desk drawer) and i found them very filling/satisfying.  but, for me, they were just a bit off mark.  i guess i expected a soft oatmeal cookie to be a bit more solid and chewy.

'quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies raisins is a product consisting of a box of six cookies.  each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope, with a tooth-edge at the top and bottom, suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope.  on the plus side, all of the cookies were intact, despite shipping.  the intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft (not crunchy) and secondarily due to the secure packaging.  the cookies were bland and unadventuresome, both in taste and in texture.  although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout   whole raisins, it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside.  therefore, the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump, juicy raisins.  in paying attention to the flavor, i noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor.  also on the plus side, in knowing (from first-hand experience) that hard oatmeal can get wedged in between fillings, resulting in damage to teeth and fillings, the older consumer will be pleased that this quaker product is totally inocuous, as far as dental work is concerned.  these cookies are, indeed, sooooooft!<br /><br />ordinary oatmeal has about   grams carbohydrate,   grams protein, and   grams fat, per   grams of oatmeal (pomeranz ( ) modern cereal science and technology (pages  - )).  the nutrition facts label that this quaker product shows that the breakdown is as follows.  each quaker cookie (  grams) contains   grams carbohydrate,   grams of fat, and only   grams of protein.  hence, it can be seen, that the cookies, as compared to straight oatmeal, is somewhat low in protein.  the low protein content should not be a concern to most adults, because growth, and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth, is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation, and for growing children.  if any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product, is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings, and need to worry about dental damage.  although this cookie is fine for children, please remember that much better sources of protein are available, e.g., milk, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, tofu, and legumes (peas, beans, lentils).', 'i love homemade oatmeal raisin cookies, the kind that are a little chewy, made with lots of oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and not too many raisins.  so i was skeptical of this soft, \"store bought\" cookie.  i assumed it would be, well, bad.  i was pleasantly surprised.  it\\'s made with whole grains, which imbues each cookie with  % of daily fiber recommendations.  it was indeed soft, but it didn\\'t seem artificially so, more like it was just cooled down from the oven.<br /><br />as i began my \\'taste test\\', i appreciated the fact that the cookies are individually wrapped, which allows for easy transport in lunches or purses.  i took a small bite at first, because i was already prepared to be disappointed.  as that bite went down, i reached for another.  then another.  very tasty, as it turned out!  soon the cookie was gone and i realized i wanted another one!  however, at   calories each, these are not \"low calorie\", they\\'re just made with better ingredients than most.<br /><br />as for other nutrition information (other than the fiber and calorie count mentioned above), each cookie has   milligrams of sodium, so not too bad there.  you\\'ll find  % of calcium and  % of iron (recommended daily requirements).<br /><br />the first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  sugar is about number   or so on the ingredient list.  one quibble i have is that the list of ingredients is rather lengthy.  my nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists, probably means there\\'s lots of stuff in there that\\'s not exactly \"good\" for us, but it is what it is:  a factory-made, store-bought cookie that\\'s got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that

(my favorite cookie, by the way!)  it almost has a cake like consistency, and while it isn't the type of cookie i would munch on at home while i watch a blu-ray, this is the type of snack i would buy for road trips or picnics.  there is a hint of brown sugar, not overwhelming, but enough that my little ones (  and  ) remarked that they liked the sweetness of it.  my oldest, wished there were more raisins, and i would have to agree with that as well.  but i liked the whole grains. overall, it is good, but a bit dry.<br /><br />size-this is a larger cookie, similar to what you would get in say subway or starbucks.  not overly huge, but not too small either.  i think this is a perfect snack size.<br /><br />nutrition-at   calories it isn't a lightweight, but nor is it overly fattening either.    grams of fat,  .  grams of saturated (not horrific), but it has some polyunsaturated and  .  grams of monounsaturated=the 'good' kind of fat.    grams of fiber, good in a snack like this, but only   grams a protein, wish there was more.<br /><br />all in all, this isn't a snack i would buy on a regular basis.  maybe once in awhile for school lunches, and i would certainly get this for a road trip, or a hike.  compared to many other snacks like this, it is a decent value for the money, and if you enjoy a thicker cookie, this is right up your alley!\", 'me and my kids loves this.. so soft and healthy and soooo good... easy packed and grab and go... i cant stop one just one... lol', 'these cookies are soft and chewy and the real raisins add a nice touch.  while they are   calories per cookie, the good taste makes them worth it.  they are also individually wrapped which makes them easy to add to a packed lunch.  they are almost as good as mom used to make!', 'i sampled this product for the influenster mom vox box that i received in the mail.  i am purchase quaker cereals on a regular basis and was excited to try this cookie.  i really enjoyed the flavor of the cookie and felt it stayed true to the quaker brand.  i did not like the fact there were so many preservatives in the cookie like tbhq and bht.  for those reasons i will not be purchasing this on a regular basis.', 'the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie with raisins were so moist with a fresh baked taste.  they had just the right amount of raisins to make them taste just like home made cookies.', 'i recieved the quaker soft baked oatmeal and raisins cookie in my influenster mom voxbox  . my husband and kids devoured the cookie before i had a chance to look at it or taste it. so this is what they thought of the cookie. it was sooooo good according to my   year old son and   year old daughter. my husband said it was moist and soft and delicious. he is most definitely ready for me to asdd it to the grocery list. i gave this product a   star rating because these cookie totally rock!!!', \"tried the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies. they were so good, nice and soft,fresh and just the right amount of raisins. even my kids liked them. you have no idea what you are missing out on if you don't try them.\", 'i like soft cookies, but most of the ones you buy taste \"fake\".  really enjoyed the quaker soft baked with raisins.  i recieved a sample in my mom voxbox from influenster and loved it.  i buy them to use as quick snacks, taste sweet and delicious but are healthier than other options.', 'quaker made with whole grain oats very soft ,healthy &  have rasin naturally flavored ,healthy product. have iron  % , fiber   grams also calcium  %.', \"this cookie was very moist but it did not crumble when you took it out of the package.  it was full of flavor but it didn't satisfy your snack hunger.  i will definitely be buying more of these\", 'they are really soft and somewhat fresh tasting but i thought they had to many raisins.i dont think i would buy again.', 'i received a sample (oatmeal & raisin) from my mom voxbox and love it. not to sweet and very moist...just right.', 'my son and i tasted these cookies from a momvox i reciieved. we have had these cookies before and love them', 'these cookies were soft, great tasting and affordable!

as such, i was somewhat skeptical of the quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies, as i\\'m generally let down by store-bought cookies. well, i\\'m here to tell you, i have become a believer. i have seen the light! here\\'s a breakdown of what i think overall:<br /><br />texture:<br />the package says \"soft-baked,\" and brother, it is no lie. these cookies are soft, moist and chewy, thus negating the need to do the milk dunk. though, ice cold milk is a requisite with cookies, regardless.<br /><br />serving size:<br />at  , these cookies are pretty well-sized and will definitely satisfy even the hardiest of sugar seekers. it would take   oreos to match the size of one oatmeal raisin. no contest.<br /><br />taste:<br />dynamite. sweet cinnamon and raisins definitely prevail in this recipe, giving the oatmeal an authentic, homemade flavor.<br /><br />nutritional profile:<br />now, this is where quaker loses a few points with me. though certainly not the unhealthiest cookie out there (in fact, it\\'s probably on the healthier end of the spectrum), there are a few select ingredients that could be avoided, such as corn syrup. but, each cookie does contain   of fiber, as well as several grams of healthy fats, and   protein! for those who are curious, here\\'s the complete nutrient breakdown:<br /><br />serving size:   cookie ( )<br />calories:  <br />total fat:   ( %)<br />saturated fat:  .  ( %)<br />polyunsaturated fat:  <br />monounsaturated fat:  . <br />cholesterol:   ( %)<br />sodium:   ( %)<br />total carbohydrate:   ( %)<br />dietary fiber:   ( %)<br />sugars:  <br />other carbohydrate:  <br />protein:  <br /><br />ingredients: whole grain oat flour, enriched flour (bleached and unbleached wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), raisins, whole grain rolled oats, sugar, whole wheat flour, palm and high oleic canola oil (with tbhq [preservative]), fructose, invert sugar syrup, mid-oleic sunflower oil, raisin paste, inulin, granola (whole grain rolled oats, sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean oil*, honey, brown sugar molasses), dried eggs, modified corn starch, corn syrup, polydextrose, leavening agents (sodium bicarbonate, ammonium bicarbonate), oat fiber, propylene glycol mono- and diesters of fat and fatty acids, mono- and diglycerides, soy lecithin, bht [to preserve freshness], citric acid [to preserve freshness], wheat gluten, molasses, calcium phosphate, salt, natural flavor, cinnamon, allspice, corn starch, enzymes. *adds a dietarily insignificant amount of trans fat<br /><br />packaging:<br />stellar! each cookie is individually wrapped for easy travel and consumption, so parents can toss one in their kid\\'s lunch box, or tote one to the office for an easy snack/dessert.<br /><br />cost:<br />from what i can tell, the quaker cookies are about par for the course in terms of cost, neither on the high nor low end, making for a pretty economical choice. based on amazon\\'s pricing as i write this, the cost is slightly less than $ .  per cookie. not bad!<br /><br />overall:<br />if you\\'re looking to indulge in something sweet, somewhat healthy, and reminds you of a homemade treat, you can\\'t do much better than quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies. the only challenge will be trying to resist a second helping, especially if you still have ice cold milk remaining in your glass.', \"my box has an expiration date of september  ,  , which is a little bit less than   months (which is okay, because the cookies get eaten up fast!). the cookies, made with whole grain quaker oats, are definitely soft baked, and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite! my only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins, i couldn't taste them! it was practically just an oatmeal taste.<br /><br />each cookie's size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand. i love that they are individually wrapped because it means i can take them on the go with me! each cookie is   calories, has  .  gram of fat,   of sodium, and   of sugar. i don't recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high. this is good as treats for children's lunches though or to have them in your car when ever you go hungry.<br /><br />also, i dropped one of the cookies (still in the wrapper) on the floor and it did not crumble, which i was happy with.\", 'this is a must have for those sweet tooth cravings. my youngest child is   and isn\\'t much of a sweets eater. however, he found the sample i received from

enjoyed this cookie. so i was happy to see that the cookie didn't have too many raisins in it but enough to get some in every bite and still be able to taste the cookie. most oatmeal cookies leave a thick,dry feeling in your mouth but nothing like that with this one, perhaps because it was so soft and chewy. they are on my list to buy again. the cookie was super soft, great for my   year old to

over   years, and with a track record like that you know that they are doing something right! these soft oatmeal raisin cookies are actually quite good. each cookie weighs about  .  ounces, and is about   calories (  grams of carbohydrates). so, while they are not exactly a low-calorie snack, they aren't too bad either.<br /><br />the nice thing about them is that they are nicely filling, making them a nice afternoon snack, when you need a little something to get you through work. and, while oatmeal raisin cookies are not my favorite snack, i did find these to be quite good. as a

oatmeal better than quaker ....right? well they have been trying to expand from just the basic oatmeal for some time. these soft cookies are tasty and satisfying. in my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear. weel - they disappeared in swift order. in fact i barely got to taste more than one. the general consensus is these are 'just like homemade. there is not greater compliment that can be paid. they are packaged conveniently for inclusion in school lunches etc. they certainly make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee for that unwinding moment all of us need at somour day.\", 'these cookies are much closer to homemade than most of those break-and-bake cookies out there, with similar nutritional info. very soft, with lots of plump raisins, great on the go!', \"i like oatmeal and raisin cookies but i don't eat them very often.  that's probably because my wife makes such awesome chocolate cookies.  when i do get an opportunity to try an oatmeal and raisin cookie it is usually from a store-bought package.  i usually come away impressed with how moist these pre-packaged cookies are.  that's what surprised me most about quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie;  they're soft but they aren't moist.  there is a distinct soft dryness to the cookies. the taste was good and my grand daughter quickly ate up most of them.  she liked them because they are tasty and soft.  i agree and i guess two out of three criteria is good but i was looking for one more quality\", 'maybe it was the hot weather? maybe it was the baking process?<br /><br

cookies come individually wrapped and easy to stash in lunch boxes, picnic baskets, or give to the kids as an after school snack. however, i did not find them to be the most appetizing thing in the world - especially as an adult who is used to low cal or sugar free snacks. kids hate them. i couldn't get mine to try more than one bite. even as an oatmeal cookie, they aren't that good. we found them salty and bland. yes they were soft, but also crumbly, which made a mess. i wouldn't say they are the worst i've ever tried, be definitely not as good as other quaker products.\", \"i really liked these cookies. they are sort of firm but not crunchy, so they don't get crumbs everywhere. they worked really well for me as a post breakfast snack (or sadly even breakfast on some days).  they

not to mention they are a guilt free snack:<br /><br />-made with whole grain quaker oats<br />-individually packaged<br />-provides a good source of fiber<br />-contains   grams of total fat per serving<br /><br />definite buy, if on sale stock up.\", \"i recieve sample of this cookie from influenster to try out. i normally dislike cookie with raisins but this one was good. i will not get these again but thats not because it wasn't a good cookie its because of the raisins. i will how ever try these in other flavors.\", 'i love these cookies. they have a wonderful chewy texture, a bursting with raisins and taste truly homemade. at first i was concerned the cookies may have picked up some of the flavor from the packaging, but the flavor, while helping to maintain the freshness of the cookies, had  no effect on the flavor. i love the baked through flavor of the cookies, they baked to perfection - not underbaked and certainly not overbaked because they are nice and chewy. i will definitely consider these cookies as a pantry item for when i need a treat, but did not have time to  bake cookies for the kids myself.<br /><br />disclaimer: i received a mom voxbox through

what it was he took it and ran off. i was surprised by this, but i opened it up for him and he ate it right up. see my son jordan is autistic and he is a very picky eater. he is also picky about his snacks. he hates raisins, i have never been able to get him to eat them . but he loved the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies. ever since we received these when he sees a quaker cookie box we have to buy it he thinks they are the same cookies. these are so great they come in their own wrappers so you can take them when you are on the run and they are way healthier then most cookies out there.',

soft baked oatmeal cookie from the masters of oatmeal.  my expectations were high.<br /><br />this is a good cookie, but not a great one, so i was a little disappointed.  the consistency is excellent, just what you would want from a soft baked cookie.  and it is defintely enough for a snack - at  .  oz and   calories - that's plenty. the raisins, too were outstanding. but the cookie itself was not great tasting. i wanted bigger hunks of oatmeal-- more texture, and there was an aftertaste of the preservatives.\", 'the soft baked oatmeal cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade.  they are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt (which is exactly how i like my cookies).  and even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  and there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.  on the flip side, the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that i cannot pronounce (is a red flag for me).', \"nice flavor, and only   calories per cookie; the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies are tasty.  but they're just not something to get overly excited about.  if oatmeal cookies are your definition of snacking nirvana, you might find these well worth trying.\", 'these cookies were a hit with everyone in our family from the oldest ( ) to the youngest (  months.)  the cookies were very soft and tasty.  each cookie was full of raisins, and still retained an \"oatmeal\" taste.  they are sized perfectly, one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box.  my only complaint is that they were crumbly.  this was fine for my   month old twins, as they still don\\'t have all of their teeth, and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies.  i had a problem with the crumbly texture, because when i tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk, a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass, where it turned into inedible mush.  aside from that one complaint, i have nothing bad to say about these yummy cookies.', \"these are delicious, no question. they seem to have achieve the perfect level of sweetness, unlike most cookies with are a lot more sugary tasting. kudos.<br /><br />there are also plenty of raisins, so at least part of its sweetness comes from a more natural source.<br /><br />my only complaint is the cookies were surprisingly dry. they are very well packaged, so i don't think that was the problem. maybe they're made that way. but i've also heard that some products aren't great to order by mail in hot summer months, as they may dry out. i know mine probably spent at least a few hours on the porch in   degree weather. dunking the cookie in tea or milk, or microwaving them for   seconds helped a lot.<br /><br />otherwise, these were yummy and seem more healthy than other choices.\", \"these cookies are pretty good.  they are soft and flavorful.  they are not amazing or as good as homemade, but what packaged cookie is?  these are better than other packaged cookies we've tried, and the nutrition information isn't horrible either.\", 'these cookies are soft, but not crumbly like so many mass-produced \"soft\" cookies.  they have a good amount of raisins and slight oatmeal-spice flavor.  a plus is the individual wrappings, good for taking on an outing, packing in school lunches or even selling at a bake sale.  don\\'t expect the same chewiness or intensity of oat flavor as bakery or homemade cookies, but as store shelf cookies go, i\\'ve had worse (chips ahoy \"chewy gooey\" for instance).', 'these are pretty tasteless, and the texture is all wrong.<br /><br />an oatmeal cookie should have a good texture, you should bite into something a little crunchy.  while i understand these are \"soft-baked\", i still expected to have some differentiation between the outer edges and the inside of the cookie.  there was none. they just don\\'t taste that good.<br /><br />i ate one, my husband ate one, and the rest are still sitting in a box on the counter.', 'i did not love the taste or texture of this cookie. it is somehow simultaneously soft and dry  and gritty. the taste is nothing remarkable. and, it is not particularly healthy- not bad, but the stats arent great for one small-ish cookie.<br /><br />give it a try, you may like it, but i was disappointed. i recommend bel vita biscuits as a healthier- and tastier- cookie alternative.', \"for a product like this, it's pretty good. soft, tasty, seemed fresh. they

my influenster mom voxbox, these cookies, are really good and soft and chewy! i really enjoyed it! it tasted fresh, and not at all like a packaged cookie, i was also impressed at how well it held together during shipping, it was not crumbly like other cookies that have arrived in the mail.', 'these individually wrapped cookies taste fairly good. a little on the bland side, but the good side of the bland side, if there is such a thing. they are a nice sized cookie...bigger than other packaged cookies that come in the plastic trays. they have the perfect amount of raisins in them - not over packed, but just enough. i guess i expected them to be more \"oatmealy\" since they are from quaker, after all. they have the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor going on, but not the texture.<br /><br />the complaint that i have with them is that they are so very dry. you will definitely want to have a big glass of milk handy. that itself was another problem for me - i don\\'t drink milk. i just don\\'t like it. yes, it is a personal problem, not a fault of quaker of course, but what else do you drink with cookies? nothing else seems to go quite right with cookies. i do like to dunk cookies in milk, but these oatmeal raisin cookies are not a good choice for that because they would get mushy and fall apart right away.<br /><br />i can\\'t say that i\\'d buy these. much too dry for me and not enough flavor to make up for it.', \"came as an  -pack, individually wrapped.  bottom line- they're awesome!  soft, chewy, about  /  inch thick and full of oatmeal-raisiny goodness, you can't go wrong with these!  soooo good!\", \"look, it's simple.  you want a good oatmeal raisin cookie, you bake them yourself or go to a bakery.  stuff you get out of a box like this will never come close.  that said, for what this is, it's not bad.  at   in the morning when you're having a cookie emergency, they'll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  but don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.<br /><br />i can't really recommend them, but i can't entirely dismiss them either.  consider them stop-gap and buy accordingly.\", \"oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite type of cookie. my grandma makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies and a lady at church makes the second best. however, i'm always willing to try someone else's oatmeal raisin cookies. recently, quaker started selling these soft-baked oatmeal cookie with raisins. the cookies themselves aren't too bad. they're better than the usual store-bought oatmeal cookie. they're soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste. however, there's nothing that really distinguishes them either. there are   cookies in a box. they are good cookies that make a nice after lunch dessert or an in between snack.\", \"who doesn't love oatmeal cookies made with quaker oats? i have many fond memories of enjoying making cookies straight out of the quaker oat box, enjoying them after-school or having them packed in my school lunchbag. when i saw these were available to test, i was naturally excited, i've always loved quaker oats and they make a quality product. always.<br /><br />unfortunately, i found these cookies to be remarkably bland and quite plain. they aren't sweet enough for my particular taste, nor are they remarkable in any way. sure they have whole grain. but they taste too bland for me, and are indeed quite plain. no one in my family liked them. they were just completely generic. for me, they needed more cinnamon and sugar and vanilla for my taste preference.<br /><br />there are   individual cookies sealed in tiny packs, making them useful for travel/lunches.\", \"i love oatmeal cookies, so i was really enthused about giving a new brand a try. however, these failed miserably in my mind - each individual cookie has   of sugar, yet there is a dry, bland taste. combined with the fact that there are   calories,   grams of fat and   mg of sodium in each cookie, it's hardly worth eating if you don't even enjoy the taste!\", \"as promised, these cookies are nice and soft, and they're chewy.  those are the good points.  the bad points are that they don't have all that much flavor.  they also have a heavier consistency than what i would prefer.  these cookies would benefit from more of the kinds of spices that can make cookies tasty- cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatnot.  i'd be willing to try these in a chocolate chip or other chocolate version, as the chocolate would add some flavor value, but i wouldn't go out of my way to eat these again.\", \"i hardly noticed the raisins in this cookie, which is great if you don't like raisins, but i do like them.  the oatmeal flavor for the cookie is just as it should be.  when first opening the packet the aroma hinted at maybe a pinch of cinnamon added or maybe nutmeg in the mix.<br /><br />the consistency though was spongy, and rather dry.  i needed something to drink with it to help moisten it up.\", 'i was impressed with the list of ingredients that included whole grain oat and whole grain wheat flour as well as whole grain rolled oats. most cookies labeled \"oatmeal\" have enriched white flour as their main ingredient.  these cookies also have a generous amount of juicy raisins, not the dried out raisins found in some other brands.<br /><br />i did find the cookies a bit too sweet for my taste, especially on the first bite.  the sweetness was much less strong after that first bite. there is a natural grain aftertaste that i found pleasant but others may not.  also, i found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened. i found that if i let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking.<br /><br />i liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale.  i also liked that the ingredient list is on each package; this is very important for those with food allergies if the box is not available.<br /><br />all in all though these are a good treat. very enjoyable.  i would give it  .  stars if that rating were possible.', \"if you're thin & can eat cookies, enjoy yourself.  these come in single packs of mid-sized cookies (.  oz. each), so i suppose it can help with portion control.  however, at   calories, it's pretty high for those needing to lose weight.  it only contains   of protein.  it also contains   of sugar, so i wouldn't call this a friendly treat for those people battling diabetes or who are borderline diabetics.  the ingredients are in very tiny print, in a box that is over  .  inches in length, & contains loads of ingredients i can barely pronounce & have no idea what they are.  it's is kinda soft & tastes okay; but it's not a cookie a foodie like myself gushes over.\", \"i didn't expect a lot from a pre-packaged cookie, but i was pleasantly surprised by the quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin!  it was surprisingly soft and chewy.  i also love that it's a somewhat healthy snack.  it would be even better warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds.  good job, quaker :)<br /><br />i received this product complimentary for testing purposes through the influenster mom voxbox.\", \"i received this cookie to test from influenster.  i had the raisin cookie

breakfast option for me.  i'm an on-the-go mom and it's easy to grab this to eat for breakfast or as a snack any time of day.  the cookie is a good size and it is moist and yummy.  i really liked it

so to heat it up.  the individually wrapped cookies make them great to pack in lunches or keep in the car for an afternoon snack.  truthfully, if they weren\\'t individually wrapped, you could probably eat several in one sitting without even realizing it.<br /><br />go ahead and plate them up and say you cooked them yourself.  they are pretty great!  oh, and they\\'re not bad

anything less from these cookies. i was not disappointed. the cookies are soft, chewy, and filling. they have the right amount of cinnamon and rasins in them. my kids even like them which is hard when

raisins are moist. my only complaint is the the cookie didn't stay together. it breaks apart very easily,\", 'i really loved the taste of these cookies. they tasted like they were home baked instead of manufactured like most store bought or packaged cookies. they seemed more nutritional than normal packaged cookies. i used to not like oat meal cookies but this may have changed my mind. i would definitely buy these again.', 'i like to buy them for my kids they love them and theyre also good for them, they are soft and chewy healthy and the taste is great', 'these cookies are amazing! great

find a great snack for the kids but these cookies come individually wrapped and fit easily in your diaper bag, purse, lunch box or car. i would recommend these to every one:)', 'i shared these with my toddler. we both loved them. they are soft and practically melt in your mouth. they are so soft and delicious. the fact that they are healthy also helps and makes me feel great about giving them to my kids.', \"as soon as i received my sample in the influenster mom voxbox from influenster.com my   yr old ate it leaving me only a bite to sample. so i went to walmart to buy more. all they had were the apple cinnamon ones and he ate the entire box! i luckily put up   cookie just in case and that was my cookie. hubby and him are addicted and i can see why. they taste very fresh and everyone loves them!<br />i got to try this product for free in my momvoxbox from influenster.com<br />i'm an influenster and influence friends and family and yes, even strangers into trying new and amazing products!\", \"quaker's soft baked oatmeal cookies with raisins are ok, but they left me wanting something better.  i thought they tasted good, but i found them to be a little on the dry side.  a lot of packaged cookies have an odd chemical aftertaste, but i didn't really notice much with these.<br /><br />however, i would like to see better choices on ingredients.  first, i don't understand the need for both bleached and unbleached flour.  quaker should just stick with unbleached.  second, i accept sugar as an ingredient.  these are cookies.  cookies are sweet, and i expect sugar.  yet why do they also have to use fructose, invert sugar syrup, corn syrup, and polydextrose?  these also contain molasses, which are a natural sweetener.  finally, these have both corn starch and modified corn starch.  again, why?  you may find other ingredients that you would question, but these seemed like the glaring issues to me.  in the end, i think this is too much to overcome when you combine it with a relatively high percentage (  out of  ) of calories from fat.  in short, i cannot recommend these cookies.\", \"i received one box of these cookies from the amazon vine program. i had not done any rsearch on them previously but remembered the oatmeal cookies my grandmother baked and how tasty they were. i was anxious to try out the quaker version. when the box arrived the first thing i noticed, right on the front of the box, was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping   calories. when i was a super active kid i ate my grandmother's cookies with impunity although i did not know the calorie count. i was always a skinny kid regardless of what i ate. now, as an adult, i am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and i do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies. however, i wanted to do a taste test so i took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies. they have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count. dry, stale and tasteless are the best descriptions i can come up with.\", \"i received a box of these cookies through the amazon vine program, and i am not impressed.  i had rather high expectations since i generally like quaker products, and my family eats a lot of their chewy granola bars. these cookies are quite disappointing. they are soft, but they are also very dry. the raisins are totally desiccated and not even chewy because they are so dry and shriveled. the cookies themselves have a dry, rather powdery texture. at   calories per cookie, i plan to stick with quaker's chewy granola bars which taste much better and are in the  -  calorie range.\", \"when it has came down to quaker, they have really made some great products for snacking along the busy day. from their classic granola bars, to instant oatmeal on the go. but they have decided to step that up again with their soft baked oatmeal cookies. they absolutely taste very good. the feeling of being a simple cookie are worth their while. my only gripes about them is that their only   in a package so if you really are a heavy cookie snacker, you'll be a bit dissapointed. also, there aren't that many in a package compared to the amount there are in a box from little debbie or other brands of cookies. nevertheless, they are definitely delightful from quaker, and if you're looking for a alternative to cookies, than this would be a good box to try.<br /><br />price: b<br /><br />taste: a-<br /><br />overall: b+\", 'i am a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, and enjoy eating them for a snack or dessert. these are very good pre-made soft oatmeal-raisin cookies, and i have really enjoyed eating them. they are soft, chewy and they taste great. they are not too bad when it comes to nutrition either - each one of them is just   calories. the only downside for me about these cookies is that they seem to be a bit too crumbly, and not gooey enough. each cookie comes in an individual wrapping, so tehy are very convenient to take with you for a snack on a go, and the individual wrapping also helps preserve freshness. overall, a very good choice for fulfilling your sweet cravings.', \"the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie, raisins have very good packaging, one relatively sturdy outside box and individually wrapped cookies inside. this is the high point. it goes down hill from there.<br /><br />let me start with the taste. it is average at best, it is soft, but very cardboardy in taste which makes the sweetness of the raisins stand out even more. often times with food, the trade-offs are great taste with bad nutrition versus average/bad taste with good nutrition. this one has both average/bad taste and bad nutrition. so what's the point of eating not-very-tasty junk food?<br /><br />because let's face it, that's what this is. the list of ingredients is unnaturally long -   lines (yes sixteen lines) of ingredients on the box, including fan favorite corn syrup. this is just an oatmeal cookie for crying out loud.<br /><br />and here's the bad nutrition:   calories per cookie, including  % cholesterol,   sugars,  % sodium ( ). on the plus side,   of dietary fiber and   of protein. other numbers from the label:   of fat ( .  saturated),   total carbs, and single digit percentages of iron and calcium. each cookie weighs around  .  ounces, so this is not a giant cookie.<br /><br />if you are going to eat a cookie, at least eat a cookie you actually like. otherwise, what's the point?\", \"let me start off by saying i'm a bit of a cookie snob having lived next door to my grandmother for most of my youth.  there's nothing better than a homemade cookie.  having tried these and shared them with some co-workers i can honestly say that it's not just me that wasn't impressed.  there wasn't much said that was positive.  for being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry.  it was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie.  there was no yummy buttery taste.  they just weren't worth the   cals per cookie.  the only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks.\", \"i must admit this was one great product. not only did i enjoy these my son's did as well . they were a big hit today at my sons birthday party and i intend to keep purchasing!! great job!\", 'i receive a sample of this cookie in  a complimentary box to review from influenster it was delicious i have never tried these but i would recommend them to anyone', '<span class=\"tiny\"> length::  :  mins<br /><br /></span>these are very good, not too sweet, not too crumbly, slightly dry, good raisins with low ratio, excellent texture, very natural tasting (nothing artificial), dense & filling enough.  for a store bought cookie, they are very good.  there is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  they taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  these hold up well.  the raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  they are moderately sized, smaller that i would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  they are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, i thought they were very good.<br /><br />one thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using quaker oats and being a good source of fiber.  they do have  % fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry  % of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  just don\\'t think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  but if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway.', \"i received quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie in raisin complimentary from influenster for reviewing purposes.<br /><br />i have an off again on again relationship with oatmeal cookies because some oatmeal cookies have a very gritty texture from the oatmeal. i was pleasantly surprised that the pieces of cookie i tested were not very gritty, and the raisin was delicious. there is no way these were not homemade in some shape or fashion. they are so delicious.<br /><br />with only   grams of fat,  calories, and   of sugar per serving (  cookie) i would consider it a healthier alternative to other cookies on the market. i've already went to the store and purchased another box.<br /><br />you won't be disappointed in trying

it shouldn t bother you  br    br   i loved the allspice taste  but my guy friend didn t that much   i think he s just partial to my cookies   the individual serving size is nice   i m more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale   i could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and           br    br   they are delicious and make me feel like i m eating something that is somewhat healthy for me   after all  there is oatmeal in the cookie ', 'i love the soft bakes

oatmeal cookies are chewy  moist  a slightly crisp outer layer    but these cookies are cakey throughout   the other thing that sets them apart from homemade cookies is a slight taste of preservatives  or something  something different and packaged tasting about the flavor   they re not too sweet  which i like   my kids have started revolting against granola bars and protein bars as snacks on our day trips  i think this would be a good thing to take instead   filling  good energy boost  tastes better than an energy bar ', 'these are nice soft  spicy oatmeal cookies with a rich molasses flavor

store bought ', 'i was surprised i liked it  i normally don t like oatmeal cookies  but these were sooo soft and chewy  it was delicious  i shared one with my daughter and she wolfed it down ', 'oatmeal cookies aren t my favorite but i do enjoy them from time to time but you would never know it by this cookie   the first bite was pretty terrible  though they did seem to get better about half way through the cookie   it was so dry and had a sawdust kind of texture   i think the problem is the main ingredient is ground up oats  then with whole oats and wheat flour  instead of the recipes i ve made with more whole oats and then wheat flour   even though i don t really like raisins they were the best thing about these cookies   at least a bite with a raisin was a tiny bit moister  br

will devour these cookies  they must be super good because believe it or not my kids are picky cookie eaters  i do not like raisins personally so i haven t tried them myself  my only negative thing i can think of is that they are very crumby because they are soft  so with kids it gets quite messy ', 'quaker  which knows a thing or two about oats  has put together a pretty nice oatmeal cookie here  the cookie is soft  as advertised  but is not pillowy  doughy  gooey or some other displeasing variety of soft  rather  it just has a nice yielding softness  no doubt related to the consistency  the

perfect for lunch boxes and take along snacks  we have enjoyed these cookies and look forward to more flavors ', 'generally  these quaker oatmeal cookies were a disappointment   the major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour   other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet  individually wrapped  and it is soft  but not crumbly   my husband and i tried these cookies for dessert last night   the first issue was that they are   calories each  meaning we only had one  even though their size is not particularly large  around   inches in diameter   second  the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made  it will not remotely remind you of homemade   third  and personally  there are not enough raisins   finally  both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring  which was border line too much  the ingredients list indicates allspice as well   the only  fortifications  to the cookie are calcium      and iron      ', 'these cookies are alright  except that once you are finished you may notice an aftertaste and i think this is due to the cookies containing too much allspice   the cookies also contain cinnamon  which does not leave an aftertaste ', 'the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie was given to me to sample through influenster mom vox box program   it tasted like it was home baked   i did notice it was a little heavy in the cinnamon department  so if you don t like cinnamon or if you have an allergy to it  then this would not be a good cookie for you   this was shared with my   year old daughter that gave her seal of approval  too ', 'quaker cookies for me is that one in the package is suffice for me with a cup of tea or hot cocoa  usually i go digging for a few more cookies to conquer my sweet tooth but not this time ', 'this is a really good cookie  didnt really think that i would like a cookie from a company known for its oatmeal  but completely surprised   it was soft

 lol  but i wanted to taste the cookie before i gave it to my daughter  so i ll give my review based on how well she liked it  the cookie was extremely fresh when i opened it  my daughter ate about half of the cookie before putting the pack down  so i ll take that as she was somewhat satisfied because if she doesn t like it  she throws it aways and if she really likes it she ll eat it all  ha  i am interested in finding out what other types of cookies are available because it is a more healthier alternative versus her eating chips or candy  br    br     note  in my review  i only took into account my thoughts on the cookie itself   but if i had to grade this with the price that amazon has it for  i would probably give it   star   a   pack of these cookies is      so why is a   pack almost    on here   am i missing something  lol  ', 'these soft cookies are very tasty and have a great texture  they are just the right size for an afternoon snack ', 'i have only tried quaker

have liked more raisins   they were also very soft almost  as another reviewer mentioned   powdery   they did have a good taste and they are very convenient  good for lunches  tucked in a backpack or

oatmeal cookies raisins is a product consisting of a box of six cookies   each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope  with a tooth edge at the top and bottom  suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope   on the plus side  all of the cookies were intact  despite shipping   the intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft  not crunchy  and secondarily due to the secure packaging   the cookies were bland and unadventuresome  both in taste and in texture   although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout   whole raisins  it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside   therefore  the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump  juicy raisins   in paying attention to the flavor  i noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor   also on the plus side  in

content should not be a concern to most adults  because growth  and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth  is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation  and for growing children   if any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product  is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings  and need to worry about

ingredients is rather lengthy   my nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists  probably means there s lots of stuff in there that s not exactly  good  for us  but it is what it is   a factory made  store bought cookie that s got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that don t come naturally to  homemade cookies    just

would buy on a regular basis   maybe once in awhile for school lunches  and i would certainly get this for a road trip  or a hike   compared to many other snacks like this  it is a decent value for

option   i highly recommend them ', 'my cookie hound husband was into them almost before they were out of the mailbox   the quality and taste are very much the same as archway brand  that is a good thing as i consider them to be the best store bought cookie out there   my husband would have liked more whole oats in the mix  but understands that too few people appreciate texture in their food  br    br   the individual wrapping might be nice for kids  lunches but is an expensive and unecological waste for the  typical  case that a group will be eating them and or individuals will eat more than one   at the very  very  least wrap them two at a time  br    br   if they re priced similarly to archway  i would expect them to do at least as well as the equivalent archway cookies ', 'these individually sealed oatmeal raisin cookies are tasty  and soft  but a bit dry  they need to be a little more moist  especially since the whole point of cookies in individual foil wrappers is to protect moisture  the taste is traditional cinnamon raisin  and the taste is fine  but in this crowded market  with many competitors  quaker cannot afford for the cookies not to be perfectly moist  br    br   i remember back when the quaker oats came in a round  cardboard container  on the side of that container was a recipe for oatmeal cookies  which my mom used to make frequently  those cookies  with nestle s chocolate chips added  were the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies i ever tasted  now  if quaker could market those cookies and make  em taste as good as mom s  then they d have something ', 'they re cookies so they re not just terrible  but i ve had lots better soft baked cookies than these   they are pretty bland  just a mild raisiny sweetness and the texture is dry and crumbly and turns a little mealy upon chewing   i tried them in coffee and in milk to see if they were better that way and while the taste was a little better the texture just became wet and mealy and bits fell off into my coffee   a soft cookie can definitely be moist  hold up to milk and have a bit of chew to it   pepperidge farm makes an addictive soft baked oatmeal cookie ', 'one star for being soft  one for having oatmeal  one for having raisins  but that s it  these cookies taste fine  but they are pretty dry and fairly crumbly  not overly enjoyable  they d be fine dunked in milk or something  but i d be afraid half of it would fall into the glass  little debbie and pepperidge farms have both proven that you can sell packaged  soft baked cookies that are still moist  plus  these seem over packaged  individually wrapped cookies  okay  yeah it s handy for a packed lunch or something  but really  that seems excessive  i d probably skip these ', 'this is a great product  moist flavorful cookie that is packaged nicely so you can take it on the go  this is a great to go breakfast or a snack anytime of the day ', 'tasty cookie   it was soft  though maybe just a little dry   the raisins were actually nice and juicy  not all dried up like in most packaged cookies   pretty good overall ', 'this cookie is big enough to share  i love the taste this cookie is more on the dry side not so much chewy so if you like the harder drier cookies this is for you ', 'i received this product free to test from influenster com and couldnt have been more excited to try   i love soft baked cookies  but i find that whenever i try to buy ones that are already made  they don t taste fresh   the quaker soft baked cookie is large and fulfilling   the taste was fresh as though it had

store i plan to keep this all the time they are a great snack', 'let s be honest  there are few desserts that can compete with a fresh baked  chewy oatmeal cookie  even better when it s oatmeal raisin  as such  i was somewhat skeptical of the quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies  as i m generally let down by store bought cookies  well  i m here to tell you  i have become a believer  i have seen the light  here s a breakdown of what i think overall  br    br   texture  br   the package says  soft baked   and brother  it is no lie  these cookies are soft  moist and chewy  thus negating the need to do the milk dunk  though  ice cold milk is a requisite with cookies  regardless  br    br   serving size  br   at    these cookies are pretty well sized and will definitely satisfy even the hardiest of sugar seekers  it would take   oreos to match the size of one oatmeal raisin  no contest  br    br   taste  br   dynamite  sweet cinnamon and raisins definitely prevail in this recipe  giving the oatmeal an authentic  homemade flavor  br    br   nutritional profile  br   now  this is where quaker loses a few points with me  though certainly not the unhealthiest cookie out there  in fact  it s probably on the healthier end of the spectrum   there are a few select ingredients that could be avoided  such as corn syrup  but  each cookie does contain   of fiber  as well as several

  from what i can tell  the quaker cookies are about par for the course in terms of cost  neither on the high nor low end  making for a pretty economical choice  based on amazon s pricing as i write

t do much better than quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies  the only challenge will be trying to resist a second helping  especially if you still have ice cold milk remaining in your glass ', 'my box has an expiration date of september       which is a little bit less than   months  which is okay  because the cookies get eaten up fast    the cookies  made with whole grain quaker oats  are definitely soft baked  and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite  my only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins  i couldn t taste them  it was practically just an oatmeal taste  br    br   each cookie s size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand  i love that they are individually wrapped because it means i can take them on the go with me  each cookie is   calories  has     gram of fat    of sodium  and   of sugar  i don t recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high  this is good as treats

happy with ', 'this is a must have for those sweet tooth cravings  my youngest child is   and isn t much of a sweets eater  however  he found the sample i received from influenster and he loved it  i

that you know that they are doing something right  these soft oatmeal raisin cookies are actually quite good  each cookie weighs about     ounces  and is about   calories    grams of carbohydrates

trying to expand from just the basic oatmeal for some time  these soft cookies are tasty and satisfying  in my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear  weel   they disappeared in swift order  in fact i barely got to taste more than one  the general consensus is these are  just like homemade  there is not greater compliment that can be paid  they are packaged conveniently for inclusion in school lunches etc  they certainly make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee for that unwinding moment all of us need at somour day ', 'these cookies are much closer to homemade than most of those break and bake cookies out there  with similar nutritional info  very soft  with lots of plump raisins  great on the go ', 'i like oatmeal and raisin cookies but i don t eat them very often   that s probably because my wife makes such awesome chocolate cookies   when i do get an opportunity to try an oatmeal and raisin cookie it is usually from a store bought package   i usually come away impressed with how moist these pre packaged cookies are   that s what surprised me most about quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie   they re soft but they aren t moist   there is a distinct soft dryness to the cookies  the taste was good and my grand daughter quickly ate up most of them   she liked them because they are tasty and soft   i agree and i guess two out of three criteria is good but i was looking for one more quality', 'maybe it was the hot weather  maybe it was the baking process  br    br   these cookies  although individually packed  so good for school lunches   came out a bit dry and crumbly  br    br   sure  maybe i am just a messy eater but a soft baked cookie just not crumble as much as the cookies i got crumbled  br    br   maybe if you get them at the supermarket they would be less dry  br    br   maybe if is just a general problem with the way they are produced ', 'these cookies come individually wrapped and easy to stash in lunch boxes  picnic baskets  or give to the kids as an after school snack  however  i did not find them to be the most appetizing thing in the world   especially as an adult who is used to low cal or sugar free snacks  kids hate them  i couldn t get mine to try more than one bite  even as an oatmeal cookie  they aren t that good  we found them salty and bland  yes they were soft  but also crumbly  which made a mess  i wouldn t say they are the worst i ve ever tried  be definitely not as good as other quaker products ', 'i really liked these cookies  they are sort of firm but not crunchy  so they don t get crumbs everywhere  they worked really well for me as a post breakfast snack  or sadly even breakfast on some days    they aren t coated in sugar the way a lot of prepackaged oatmeal cookies are

done a nice job with this oatmeal raisin cookie  i liked the convenience of being individually wrapped  which also preserves its freshness  i take one of these along during a round of golf and in my

might get in a vending machine   they are individually packaged and have a soft and chewy texture   the taste left me pretty unsatisfied as they were pretty bland and tasted too  processed   not like

let my   year old son and my   year old daughter try bites and they loved it and did not care that it was soft and crumbly at all  overall i would recommend trying them because the flavor is good and

premade cookies  because they are too hard for my preference  but this changes my mind   they are full of flavor   the oatmeal doesn t overpower the raisins and the raisins don t overpower the oatmeal  it s a perfect balance   the raisin were soft  not hard like other brands we ve tried in the past   the price for the quality is well worth it ', 'i absolutely fell in love with these cookies   i love my cookies soft and not hard  unless it s an oreo and then i soften it in milk  but these cookies are hands down the closest i ve had to homemade ', 'less calories than a candy bar  i will take

will be buying more of these just not in that flavor  my kids loved the cookie ', 'i ve always on the lookout for handy snacks for my teenage son   he loves soft cookies  so i was thrilled to see the soft baked oatmeal cookie from the masters of oatmeal   my expectations were high  br    br   this is a good cookie  but not a great one  so i was a little disappointed   the consistency is excellent  just what you would want from a soft baked cookie   and it is defintely enough for a snack   at     oz and   calories   that s plenty  the raisins  too were outstanding  but the cookie itself was not great tasting  i wanted bigger hunks of oatmeal   more texture  and there was an aftertaste of the preservatives ', 'the soft baked oatmeal cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade   they are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt  which is exactly how i like my cookies    and even though they are soft  they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand   and there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite   on the flip side  the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that i cannot pronounce  is a red flag for me  ', 'nice flavor  and only   calories per cookie  the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies are tasty   but they re just not something to get overly excited about   if oatmeal cookies are your definition of snacking nirvana  you might find these well worth trying ', 'these cookies were a hit with everyone in our family from the oldest     to the youngest    months    the cookies were very soft and tasty   each cookie was full of raisins  and still retained an  oatmeal  taste   they are sized perfectly  one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box   my only complaint is that they were crumbly   this was fine for my   month old twins  as they still don t have all of their teeth  and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies   i had a problem with the crumbly texture  because when i tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk  a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass  where it turned into inedible mush   aside from that one complaint  i have nothing bad to say about these yummy cookies ', 'these are delicious  no question  they seem to have achieve the perfect level of sweetness  unlike most cookies with are a lot more sugary tasting  kudos  br    br   there are also plenty of raisins  so at least part of its sweetness comes from a more natural source  br    br   my only complaint is the cookies were surprisingly dry  they are very well packaged  so i don t think that was the problem  maybe they re made that way  but i ve also heard that some products aren t great to order by mail in hot summer months  as they may dry out  i know mine probably spent at least a few hours on the porch in   degree weather  dunking the cookie in tea or milk  or microwaving them for   seconds helped a lot  br    br   otherwise  these were yummy and seem more healthy than other choices ', 'these cookies are pretty good   they are soft and flavorful   they are not amazing or as good as homemade  but what packaged cookie is   these are better than other packaged cookies we ve tried  and the nutrition information isn t horrible either ', 'these cookies are soft  but not crumbly like so many mass produced  soft  cookies   they have a good amount of raisins and slight oatmeal spice flavor   a plus is the individual wrappings  good for taking on an outing  packing in school lunches or even selling at a bake sale   don t expect the same chewiness or intensity of oat flavor as bakery or homemade cookies  but as store shelf cookies go  i ve had worse  chips ahoy  chewy gooey  for instance  ', 'these are pretty tasteless  and the texture is all wrong  br    br   an oatmeal cookie should have a good texture  you should bite into something a little crunchy   while i understand these are  soft baked   i still expected to have some differentiation between the outer edges and the inside of the cookie   there was none  they just don t taste that good  br    br   i ate one  my husband ate one  and the rest are still sitting in a box on the counter ', 'i did not love the taste or texture of this cookie  it is somehow simultaneously soft and dry  and gritty  the taste is nothing remarkable  and  it is not particularly healthy  not bad  but the stats arent great for one small ish cookie  br    br   give it a try  you may like it  but i was disappointed  i recommend bel vita biscuits as a healthier  and tastier  cookie alternative ', 'for a product like this  it s pretty good  soft  tasty  seemed fresh  they didn t last long at my house  i thought they were a bit too sweet  but the kids loved them  i d rather eat home made  but this is the next best thing ', 'quaker cookies have always been one of my favorites and these do not

and recommending them to all of my friends ', 'i received this from influenster in the mom voxbox  when i offered to my kids to try the quaker oatmeal soft baked cookie i literally had a crying baby on my hands  she did not want anyone to eat any of the cookies she says  i s mine   even getting a new box  it s mine  have to hide it   thanks   annette g', 'i know they say  soft baked  but how often is a packaged cookie really all that soft  well  these are super soft   the first thing i noticed when i opened the package was that the cookie was so soft and moist that it broke apart with little to no effort   i shared the cookie with my preschool daughter   we both loved the taste   i m not usually an oatmeal cookie fan  but i really liked this cookie   my daughter asked me to buy her more of them   that in itself makes it a winner  ha   these are great cookies and will become a staple in my pantry ', 'we love these  they are so soft and tasty  they are a healthy filling snack  so

fantastic we loved them   my kids loved them a great breakfast on the go   ', 'the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie  raisins  is a great tasting snack that gives you that full feeling  just   of these cookies gives you that satisfying full feeling  since it is made out of oatmeal and raisins  we could classify it as a healthy snack  but on the nutritional breakdown  would be better if this snack would go down on a less than   cholesterol  the per serving content of cholesterol is    sugar is    so as with any other food  moderation is the key  nevertheless  anything oatmeal gives you a great start on eating  whether to maintain a healthy lifestyle or starting one ', 'chewy  sweet goodness  these cookies are right up my alley  i even liked that they were individually packaged  great for lunch boxes or for keeping cookie monsters from devouring the entire package in one sitting  the individual cookies weren t huge but they were big and chewy enough to satisfy a sweet tooth with just one package  they weren t overly sweet or overloaded with raisins  someone must have studied the cookie to raisin ratio and came up with the perfect number  i ll definitely much on these again ', 'this is an interesting product   the texture is immediately attractive and quite remarkable given that it is a packaged product  but the flavor is not quite right  there is a sense of artificiality about the flavor that may come from preservatives or flavoring additives  my family ate all the samples we received  but there was no real drive to go out and buy a box  even among my otherwise enthusiastic cookie eating teens   i think that the product needs a trip back to the drawing board if the goal is authentic oatmeal cookie taste and not just texture   sorry ', 'as a lover of oatmeal cookies since the days of being a kid  i was anxious to try these from such a well known brand   i have always been someone that sticks to either cheaper brands  or the kind of cookies that are made in a markets own bakery   personally i think the latter are the best there is in most cases as far as store bought is concerned    as for these quaker cookies i found them to be just average in taste   the box i got held very fresh cookies individually wrapped that were satisfying in flavor  but not at all anything special   personally i don t think the heavier cost of these are worth it for just being a famous brand   you can do at least just as good with other store bought brands  and much better in my opinion in buying your local markets cookies   on the other hand if you happen to be a big fan quaker oats cookies  or just enjoy the particular flavor of these  buying them here in the big   pack is not a bad deal at all   the cost is enough to get you the free shipping  and the convenience along with the reasonable price makes it a sold deal   enjoy if these are your favor      ', 'quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies with raisins taste pretty darn good  the only draw back are they re too dry  still  much better than many other similar cookies made by other companies  some who make their products even drier and why sweeter  still  with a cup of tea or coffee they make a pretty good snack or bit of an after dinner treat  i was disappointed when i reached into the box for a cookie after lunch and realized i d already eaten them all ', 'i m always on the look out for a good tasting  individually wrapped  healthy snack that i can toss in my bag for a quick bite  oatmeal cookies are one of my favorites so i gave these a try  br    br   the packaging is fine but the cookie does not have a very good taste  it has a dry texture to it  not very oat like at all  they are soft  but not moist  there were plenty of raisens but not enough spice for my taste  on the positive side  they do contain more fiber than most cookies  but at   calories each  they are a little fattening ', 'i tried one  gave it two bites  to be sure  and then into the trash  not even close to appetizing  it s amazing  how can something be chewy and yet powdery dry and quite tasteless simultaneously  quaker s r d figured out the conundrum and produced these  cookies   i assume it s the oat bran since i had similar experiences with using it when it was the thing to do  e g   pancakes   however  what ever it is  it ain t good  i do not recommend these  not even to my sworn enemies ', 'this is a pretty good cookie in terms of taste   flavor  but as cookies go i will say it was a little dry with the actual cookie part and not as moist as i like with oatmeal cookies  the raisins were moist    each cookie is individually wrapped vs  opening up a whole box which makes for a good snack to take the edge off of your day  br    br   each cookie is   calories with   grams of fat     of recommended daily value  and   grams of dietary fiber     of the recommended daily value   so i really don t want to eat more than one a day ', 'first of all  i like that the cookies are individually wrapped  i can grab one and stick it in my pocket on my way out the door in the morning  br    br   the cookies themselves are big and a good thickness  they are soft with out being crumbly  the promised raisins are mostly small bits of chopped raisins and don t really add to the flavor of the cookie  i would have like whole raisins  the taste is mostly oatmeal with just the right amount of cinnamon  they are also dry  you really need an accompanying beverage with these  they are hearty enough that one makes a good snack  br    br   while i would never mistake these for mom s oatmeal cookies  or mine for that matter  they re not too bad for  store bought   if you like oatmeal cookies  give these a try  just have a drink ready  too ', 'i am kind of shocked that these cookies were too sweet since i have really enjoyed how quaker can make food be sweet but not too sweet  these are all individually wrapped  which is easy for on the go and keeps the cookies extra fresh  each cookie is a decent size and we ate these over a week and it kept its softness  br    br   for me  it was a bit too sweet and i am a big sweet eater  i actually don t taste the oatmeal as much and more of the raisins  which could be why it was just so sweet to me  br    br   it was still yummy and i would get it again but only if i am in a really sweet mood ', 'i loved these cookies  my daughter eat them right up  they are soft and taste great  i like softer cookies and this one was a hit with my whole family ', 'chock full of sugar   absolutely not something i would serve to my family   obviously  all cookies have sugar in them  but these seem to be a bit excessive ', 'i recently received the quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie as a part of my mom voxbox from influenster   i was a little apprehensive giving the cookie to my own two  cookie monsters  because they have not been big raisin fans  but they loved it   the texture is so soft and chewy that they gobbled it up and asked for more   they never even noticed the raisins   i will buy these again as a special treat for them   ', 'i got these in the mom voxbox from influenster  and was excited to try them  br   they

and fresh  my kids loved them    my expectations were exceeded ', 'this cookie is one of the best cookies that i have tried in a while since i do not like the hard crunchy ones like chips ahoy because

influenster to try  my son ate it so quick  i love quaker and will be looking for these on our next grocery trip  my boy said it was delicious  we already buy the chewy oatmeal bars  adding these soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies to our list of quaket products ', 'i received the raisin flavored from influenster complimentary for tasting   it was very good to me  not too sweet and not oily tasting like some package cookies  the fact that it is made with whole grain oats made it even better   i am going to buy the cranberry   yogurt next ', 'i love the home baked mom taste these have  just like my mom made them  they are also easy to find and affordable ', 'i rec d this product from influenster and quaker for testing purposes  i ve always enjoyed quaker oats from the hot oatmeal  down to the cookie itself  quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie is made with whole grain quaker oats  at least   grams of whole grains per serving  br   made with real fruit  good source of fiber  delicious  quaker oats been around since over a hundred years ', 'i received one of these awesome cookies from influenster  they are delicious   super soft and moist   tasted home made     yummy ', 'these cookies are a great cookie  i love oatmeal cookies but the only thing i didn t like was the raisins  this is only because i hate raisins  so if you like raisins then you would probably like them  i probably wouldn t repurchase this for myself because i would rather make homemade without them  i would repurchase it for my boyfriend though because he loves raisins ', 'soft  chewy and just like grandma used to make  i can t wait until i eat the next cookie as these are something to savor and enjoy ', 'from influenster i received the quaker soft baked cookie  with this product  after dinner one night  i divided it up into   equal portions  one for myself  one for my husband  and another for our       year old daughter  br   our daughter devoured the cookie before i even sat back down and was asking for more  she absolutely loved it  my husband and i  on the other hand  were not impressed  we were expecting something a little more  the cookie itself was a little dry and there was something about the taste that was off a little bit  br    br   i do not think we will be buying this product in our home in the future  but i am pleasantly pleased with the chance to try it first ', 'my whole family absolutely loves these cookies   so soft and yummy   and i like the fact that they are a nutritious treat for the kids   a much better option than candy or soda ', 'i loved how soft and delicious these cookies are  they are the new everyday snack in my house  must have ', 'i love the way these cookies taste just like homemade cookies  they are easy to take and eat on the go ', 'i thought that i might have had tried some of the tastiest oatmeal cookis before  but that wasn t so until i recently tried quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies   these cookies are so delicious  they taste just like homeade cookies  they are soft   full of raisins  and are just fabulous i bought a box at my locl walmart the other day for      for eight cookies  these are a good size cookie too  iwll be back to buy mor of them for sure thanks to the wonderful ingredients from quaker i can t wait to try out the different varieties that quaker carries  a fan for life i am  thanks quaker   thanks to influenster for giving me the chance to try these cookies in my vox box  they were a    ', 'i love this soft bake cookie i recived from quaker  br   i enjoyed the nutritious soft baked cookie and i plan to buy more for my family  great taste and price  ', 'the oatmeal raisin is the cookie that i ve tried  i love it as well as my daughter  it s soft and tastes amazing  not to mention cheap  i ll be buying more ', 'i really enjoyed the goodness of quaker oatmeal combined with soft  plump and juicy raisins in a soft cookie  it is an irrisistable snack for the entire family and leaves you feeling full and satisfied ', 'these cookies are so delicious   i received one in my influenster mom voxbox and just had to repurchase   so soft and chewy  def a must buy  happy customer over here  good job quaker', 'i received one of these cookies in my influenster mom voxbox  these cookies  are really good and soft and chewy  i really enjoyed it  it tasted fresh  and not at all like a packaged cookie  i was also impressed at how well it held together during shipping  it was not crumbly like other cookies that have arrived in the mail ', 'these individually wrapped cookies taste fairly good  a little on the bland side  but the good side of the bland side  if there is such a thing  they are a nice sized cookie   bigger than other packaged cookies that come in the plastic trays  they have the perfect amount of raisins in them   not over packed  but just enough  i guess i expected them to be more  oatmealy  since they are from quaker  after all  they have the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor going on  but not the texture  br    br   the complaint that i have with them is that they are so very dry  you will definitely want to have a big glass of milk handy  that itself was another problem for me   i don t drink milk  i just don t like it  yes  it is a personal problem  not a fault of quaker of course  but what else do you drink with cookies  nothing else seems to go quite right with cookies  i do like to dunk cookies in milk  but these oatmeal raisin cookies are not a good choice for that because they would get mushy and fall apart right away  br    br   i can t say that i d buy these  much too dry for me and not enough flavor to make up for it ', 'came as an   pack  individually wrapped   bottom line  they re awesome   soft  chewy  about     inch thick and full of oatmeal raisiny goodness  you can t go wrong with these   soooo good ', 'look  it s simple   you want a good oatmeal raisin cookie  you bake them yourself or go to a bakery   stuff you get out of a box like this will never come close   that said  for what this is  it s not bad   at   in the morning when you re having a cookie emergency  they ll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea   but don t expect a lot of home baked flavor  or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it s simply not there  br    br   i can t really recommend them  but i can t entirely dismiss them either   consider them stop gap and buy accordingly ', 'oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite type of cookie  my grandma makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies and a lady at church makes the second best  however  i m always willing to try someone else s oatmeal raisin cookies  recently  quaker started selling these soft baked oatmeal cookie with raisins  the cookies themselves aren t too bad  they re better than the usual store bought oatmeal cookie  they re soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste  however  there s nothing that really distinguishes them either  there are   cookies in a box  they are good cookies that make a nice after lunch dessert or an in between snack ', 'who doesn t love oatmeal cookies made with quaker oats  i have many fond memories of enjoying making cookies straight out of the quaker oat box  enjoying them after school or having them packed in my school lunchbag  when i saw these were available to test  i was naturally excited  i ve always loved quaker oats and they make a quality product  always  br    br   unfortunately  i found these cookies to be remarkably bland and quite plain  they aren t sweet enough for my particular taste  nor are they remarkable in any way  sure they have whole grain  but they taste too bland for me  and are indeed quite plain  no one in my family liked them  they were just completely generic  for me  they needed more cinnamon and sugar and vanilla for my taste preference  br    br   there are   individual cookies sealed in tiny packs  making them useful for travel lunches ', 'i love oatmeal cookies  so i was really enthused about giving a new brand a try  however  these failed miserably in my mind   each individual cookie has   of sugar  yet there is a dry  bland taste  combined with the fact that there are   calories    grams of fat and   mg of sodium in each cookie  it s hardly worth eating if you don t even enjoy the taste ', 'as promised  these cookies are nice and soft  and they re chewy   those are the good points   the bad points are that they don t have all that much flavor   they also have a heavier consistency than what i would prefer   these cookies would benefit from more of the kinds of spices that can make cookies tasty  cinnamon  nutmeg  and whatnot   i d be willing to try these in a chocolate chip or other chocolate version  as the chocolate would add some flavor value  but i wouldn t go out of my way to eat these again ', 'i hardly noticed the raisins in this cookie  which is great if you don t like raisins  but i do like them   the oatmeal flavor for the cookie is just as it should be   when first opening the packet the aroma hinted at maybe a pinch of cinnamon added or maybe nutmeg in the mix  br    br   the consistency though was spongy  and rather dry   i needed something to drink with it to help moisten it up ', 'i was impressed with the list of ingredients that included whole grain oat and whole grain wheat flour as well as whole grain rolled oats  most cookies labeled  oatmeal  have enriched white flour as their main ingredient   these cookies also have a generous amount of juicy raisins  not the dried out raisins found in some other brands  br    br   i did find the cookies a bit too sweet for my taste  especially on the first bite   the sweetness was much less strong after that first bite  there is a natural grain aftertaste that i found pleasant but others may not   also  i found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened  i found that if i let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking  br    br   i liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale   i also liked that the ingredient list is on each package  this is very important for those with food allergies if the box is not available  br    br   all in all though these are a good treat  very enjoyable   i would give it     stars if that rating were possible ', 'if you re thin   can eat cookies  enjoy yourself   these come in single packs of mid sized cookies     oz  each   so i suppose it can help with portion control   however  at   calories  it s pretty high for those needing to lose weight   it only contains   of protein   it also contains   of sugar  so i wouldn t call this a friendly treat for those people battling diabetes or who are borderline diabetics   the ingredients are in very tiny print  in a box that is over     inches in length    contains loads of ingredients i can barely pronounce   have no idea what they are   it s is kinda soft   tastes okay  but it s not a cookie a foodie like myself gushes over ', 'i didn t expect a lot from a pre packaged cookie  but i was pleasantly surprised by the quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin   it was surprisingly soft and chewy   i also love that it s a somewhat healthy snack   it would be even better warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds   good job  quaker    br    br   i received this product complimentary for testing purposes through the influenster mom voxbox ', 'i received this cookie to test from influenster   i had the

muffin  and wanted to know if he could have one for breakfast the next day   the cookie is very soft and the flavor is nice   it tastes great with a big glass of milk or microwaved for   seconds or so to heat it up   the individually wrapped cookies make them great to pack in lunches or keep in the car for an afternoon snack   truthfully  if they weren t individually wrapped  you could probably eat several in one sitting without even realizing it  br    br   go ahead and plate them up and say you cooked them yourself   they are pretty great   oh  and they re not bad nutritionally    so go ahead

was highly surprised at how good these were   yum   the portion was quite generous  making for a nice afternoon snack ', 'my kids really like to eat the quaker oatmeal soft cookies in the morning br    for breakfest with a big glass of milk    ', 'my whole family loved this cookie  it is very soft and tastes great  it was so soft that my   month old even got to enjoy it  too ', 'the cookie is soft and flavorful  it tastes good and the raisins are moist  my only complaint is the the cookie didn t stay together  it breaks apart very easily ', 'i really loved the taste of these cookies  they tasted like they were home baked instead of manufactured like most store bought or packaged cookies  they seemed more nutritional than normal packaged cookies  i used to not like oat meal cookies but this may have changed my mind  i would definitely buy these again ', 'i like to buy them for my kids they love them and theyre also good for them  they are soft and chewy healthy and the taste is great', 'these cookies are amazing  great for snacks for the children  nutritious yet satisfying  will keep purchasing more of these  amazing great taste ', 'what a great snack for on the run  in a purse or diaper bag  or even for a quick treat at home  was delicious and pretty healthy compared to some cookies ', 'we tried the soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies and fell in love with them  being a mom and constantly on the go its hard to find a great snack for the kids but these cookies come individually wrapped and fit easily in your diaper bag  purse  lunch box or car  i would recommend these to every one  ', 'i shared these with my toddler  we both loved them  they are soft and practically melt in your mouth  they are so soft and delicious  the fact that they are healthy also helps and makes me feel great about giving them to my kids ', 'as soon as i received my sample in the influenster mom voxbox from influenster com my   yr old ate it leaving me only a bite to sample  so i went to walmart to buy more  all they had were the apple cinnamon ones and he ate the entire box  i luckily put up   cookie just in case and that was my cookie  hubby and him are addicted and i can see why  they taste very fresh and everyone loves them  br   i got to try this product for free in my momvoxbox from influenster com br   i m an influenster and influence friends and family and yes  even strangers into trying new and amazing products ', 'quaker s soft baked oatmeal cookies with raisins are ok  but they left me wanting something better   i thought they tasted good  but i found them to be a little on the dry side   a lot of packaged cookies have an odd chemical aftertaste  but i didn t really notice much with these  br    br   however  i would like to see better choices on ingredients   first  i don t understand the need for both bleached and unbleached flour   quaker should just stick with unbleached   second  i accept sugar as an ingredient   these are cookies   cookies are sweet  and i expect sugar   yet why do they also have to use fructose  invert sugar syrup  corn syrup  and polydextrose   these also contain molasses  which are a natural sweetener   finally  these have both corn starch and modified corn starch   again  why   you may find other ingredients that you would question  but these seemed like the glaring issues to me   in the end  i think this is too much to overcome when you combine it with a relatively high percentage    out of    of calories from fat   in short  i cannot recommend these cookies ', 'i received one box of these cookies from the amazon vine program  i had not done any rsearch on them previously but remembered the oatmeal cookies my grandmother baked and how tasty they were  i was anxious to try out the quaker version  when the box arrived the first thing i noticed  right on the front of the box  was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping   calories  when i was a super active kid i ate my grandmother s cookies with impunity although i did not know the calorie count  i was always a skinny kid regardless of what i ate  now  as an adult  i am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and i do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies  however  i wanted to do a taste test so i took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies  they have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count  dry  stale and tasteless are the best descriptions i can come up with ', 'i received a box of these cookies through the amazon vine program  and i am not impressed   i had rather high expectations since i generally like quaker products  and my family eats a lot of their chewy granola bars  these cookies are quite disappointing  they are soft  but they are also very dry  the raisins are totally desiccated and not even chewy because they are so dry and shriveled  the cookies themselves have a dry  rather powdery texture  at   calories per cookie  i plan to stick with quaker s chewy granola bars which taste much better and are in the     calorie range ', 'when it has came down to quaker  they have really made some great products for snacking along the busy day  from their classic granola bars  to instant oatmeal on the go  but they have decided to step that up again with their soft baked oatmeal cookies  they absolutely taste very good  the feeling of being a simple cookie are worth their while  my only gripes about them is that their only   in a package so if you really are a heavy cookie snacker  you ll be a bit dissapointed  also  there aren t that many in a package compared to the amount there are in a box from little debbie or other brands of cookies  nevertheless  they are definitely delightful from quaker  and if you re looking for a alternative to cookies  than this would be a good box to try  br    br   price  b br    br   taste  a  br    br   overall  b ', 'i am a huge fan of oatmeal cookies  and enjoy eating them for a snack or dessert  these are very good pre made soft oatmeal raisin cookies  and i have really enjoyed eating them  they are soft  chewy and they taste great  they are not too bad when it comes to nutrition either   each one of them is just   calories  the only downside for me about these cookies is that they seem to be a bit too crumbly  and not gooey enough  each cookie comes in an individual wrapping  so tehy are very convenient to take with you for a snack on a go  and the individual wrapping also helps preserve freshness  overall  a very good choice for fulfilling your sweet cravings ', 'the quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie  raisins have very good packaging  one relatively sturdy outside box and individually wrapped cookies inside  this is the high point  it goes down hill from there  br    br   let me start with the taste  it is average at best  it is soft  but very cardboardy in taste which makes the sweetness of the raisins stand out even more  often times with food  the trade offs are great taste with bad nutrition versus average bad taste with good nutrition  this one has both average bad taste and bad nutrition  so what s the point of eating not very tasty junk food  br    br   because let s face it  that s what this is  the list of ingredients is unnaturally long     lines  yes sixteen lines  of ingredients on the box  including fan favorite corn syrup  this is just an oatmeal cookie for crying out loud  br    br   and here s the bad nutrition    calories per cookie  including    cholesterol    sugars     sodium      on the plus side    of dietary fiber and   of protein  other numbers from the label    of fat      saturated     total carbs  and single digit percentages of iron and calcium  each cookie weighs around     ounces  so this is not a giant cookie  br    br   if you are going to eat a cookie  at least eat a cookie you actually like  otherwise  what s the point ', 'let me start off by saying i m a bit of a cookie snob having lived next door to my grandmother for most of my youth   there s nothing better than a homemade cookie   having tried these and shared them with some co workers i can honestly say that it s not just me that wasn t impressed   there wasn t much said that was positive   for being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry   it was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie   there was no yummy buttery taste   they just weren t worth the   cals per cookie   the only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks ', 'i must admit this was one great product  not only did i enjoy these my son s did as well   they were a big hit today at my sons birthday party and i intend to keep purchasing   great job ', 'i receive a sample of this cookie in  a complimentary box to review from influenster it was delicious i have never tried these but i would recommend them to anyone', ' span class  tiny   length       mins br    br     span these are very good  not too sweet  not too crumbly  slightly dry  good raisins with low ratio  excellent texture  very natural tasting  nothing artificial   dense   filling enough   for a store bought cookie  they are very good   there is nothing artificial tasting to them  they stay soft  but have a good chewy texture that holds together well   they taste a little dry  but are not dried out or too brittle   most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days   these hold up well   the raising ratio seems just right  not too many but a very good balance of sweetness   wetness in the right places   they are moderately sized  smaller that i would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box  but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense   they are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven  but relative to store bought cookies  and other oatmeal cookies  i thought they were very good  br    br   one thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using quaker oats and being a good source of fiber   they do have    fiber and pack in other good things  but they do carry    of your daily value of fat too  per cookie   compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives  these pack in good things along with the bad   just don t think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat   but if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies  these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway ', 'i received quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie in raisin complimentary from influenster for reviewing purposes  br    br   i have an off again on again relationship with oatmeal cookies because some oatmeal cookies have a very gritty texture from the oatmeal  i was pleasantly surprised that the pieces of cookie i tested were not very gritty  and the raisin was delicious  there is no way these were not homemade in some shape or fashion  they are so delicious  br    br   with only   grams of fat   calories  and   of sugar per serving    cookie  i would consider it a healthier alternative to other cookies on the market  i ve already went to the store and purchased another box  br    br   you won t be disappointed in trying these cookies out ', 'i loved this cookie  i received it in my mom vox box from influenster  and that was the first thing me and my daughter tried     she absolutely loved it  and i will be buying more and put them in my diaper bag  for on the go trips   ', 'hello  i received this cookie in my  influenster mom voxbox to review and i have to say i was very pleased with the taste  texture and the enormous size of the cookie  i am happy with quaker products  i always have been ever since i was little  i now pass the nutritional products to my children as my grandma passed it on to me ', 'i like the cookies while on the go   they are soft and chewy and have the goodness of quaker products   if you don t have time to bake  then give these cookies a try   they taste great   i sampled the product thanks to influenster and i am so thankful for that ', 'i recived a free sample from influenster and let me tell you it was so good and soft it crumbles up right in your mouth and its a big cookie my daughter also loved it i would difenitly recommend buying it if you like oatmeal and raisins', 'these cookies are a great quick snack for the kids  they did not even complain about the raisins  i think they gobble them up before they even notice ', 'i received a sample of these and quickly went out and purchased a box  these are super soft cookies that are individually wrapped for convenience  the individually wrapped cookie is a huge feature here as the cookies stay fresh and soft in a easily tote able package  you get the great taste of quaker oat cookies without the work of baking them  toss in the kids lunch bag  spouse lunch box  pack for a picnic  use in birthday party favor bags for a healthy alternative  great tasting  great portability  great texture  love them  ', 'my children love these cookies  they are very soft and taste awesome  will be buying more for sure the best cookies we ever tried ', 'these cookies were so soft and yummy  you would think they were fresh out of the oven  i will definitely be getting more of these for my house  o ', 'my whole family loves these cookies  and my son tried to stuff the whole thing in his mouth  i just bought some yesterday   i think i will have to get some more soon ', 'my kids loved these and they are great to just take and run out the door with for little snack  get some of our own ', 'i have fallen in love with quaker s soft baked oatmeal cookie  i tried them in my mom voxbox from influenster and it was so good  it tasted like a homemade cookie to me  i love the fact that these cookies are not high in sugar like other ones  i went out and bought a box of the apple cinnamon to try and love them as well  my family loves the quaker brand and will continue to buy and recommend quaker ', 'i love these soft cookies  they taste like fresh baked out of the oven  the oatmeal is very sweet and tasty', 'i absolutely loved these new cookies  they were so soft and yummy  the kids also enjoyed them  i saw them in the store also and they price wasn t bad  i ll be a returning customer for these ', 'i received this amazing soft baked oatmeal cookie in my influenster mom voxbox  i m normally not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies since i don t like raisins  but this was delicious  the cookie was thick and tasted homemade with a nice oatmeal flavor  i m definitely going to buy more of these ', 'i got this from influenster in my mom voxbox   it was very soft and tasty my husband said  as he was the one who ate it lol ', 'i got these in my influenster mom voxbox  and they were really good  they were moist and yummy  i don t like raisins so i picked them out  but the oatmeal was amazing  i will definitely buy some more  well  a flavor without raisins in them ', 'i got one of these in my influenster mom voxbox  omg they were so good  my daughter and i shared the first one then i went and got another box  this are a must have now  they are great to snack on  they are super soft  there is nothing bad to say about these cookies  you must try them ', 'a decadent go to treat   nice to keep around the house for quick meals  toss them in homemade ice cream for a yummy flavor or just grab one when you have a sweet tooth ', '  quick take  tasty  chewy  soft baked cookies with oats and raisins that the whole family can enjoy     br     usage tips  eat them as a snack  dessert or basically anytime of the day  they go well with a cup of tea or maybe with a cup of coffee in the morning  br     the verdict  next time you re at the store  don t leave without picking up some quaker soft baked oatmeal cookies  they are good to take  on the go  since they are individually packaged  they are a healthy treat  provides a good source of fiber  contains   grams of total fat per serving  and made with whole grain quaker oats  you can t beat that  try them out  i m sure you ll love them as much as i did   d', 'the cookie didn t make it much further than out of the box  it was big enough to split between my two daughters and it was a hit with my super picky eaters  i got a very small bite and loved it  it really did taste like something that could have baked in my own kitchen  i will definitely be buying more of these cookies and maybe next time i will get a whole one ', 'my kids or i didn t care for it much  they tossed it after a few bites  and what kids throw away cookies    ', 'if i could give it zero stars i would      horrible taste and not much of that either  like a very hint of molasses that was too old to use  if i had never had an oatmeal raisin cookie before and this was my first taste of one i would never try one again  quaker    pull these off the shelves of any store selling them and throw them in the garbage where they belong  this product gives quaker a bad name  please     don t waste your money on these and don t tell your kids they can have one for a treat  they are more like something you would give them for a punishment    ', 'these cookies are soft and delicious   possibly because they rely more on oat flour than just rolled oats  they lack the chewy texture of a traditional oatmeal cookie   instead they are almost melt in your mouth  with nicely soft raisins as well   perhaps the only truly detrimental characteristic is that they taste more like a raisin and spice cookie than an oatmeal cookie   i enjoy the taste of oatmeal and wouldn t mind if it was brought more to the forefront  br    br   i don t usually buy individually wrapped food  so i don t think i d buy this product again  but i would certainly recommend it to others ', 'i cannot say these taste like home made but the are not that far off  i like their chewiness and i am a crispy cookie person   these are very tasty in fact they are too tasty i wanted to eat them all at once   i would love to dip these i melted chocolate or make a sandwich cookie out of them by putting some kind of frosting or chocolate in the middle  oh my would that be great  br    br   these are not too sweet they are just right basically in every way   i like the fact that they come individually wrapped so you can put them in your lunch bag or send them with your children for their noon meal  each cookie is   calories and that is not bad considering the size of them  they are quit big and should satisfy anyone s urge for a sweet treat  br   i am very pleased with these cookies and would definitely buy them again ', 'this cookie is super soft and chewy i love it and also try their oatmeal cookies they are the bomb diggitty   i would recommend this to everyone i received this in my mom voxbox and my kids loved it  ', 'these cookies are reasonably tasty without being too sweet  the individual packing keeps them nice and moist and makes it easy to include one in a packed lunch  br    br   that said  they are not so special that i d make an effort to seek them out  also  the fact that each cookie is   calories would keep me from having them too often  luckily  the individual packing will keep them fresh till you feel like having one ', 'this is a fab product soft and chewy you cant go wrong me and my kids love them my two year old is hard for him to share he says no my cookie lol', 'i loved these cookies and so did my kids  you can read my full review here       my favorite part was definitely the taste  and i m not even an oatmeal cookie fan ', 'this is a great tasting cookie  it is very soft and the texture is very smooth  i usually do not like oatmeal cookies because the texture is very gritty and tough  this cookie does not have that problem  it tastes like your mom just made it ', 'these are great for a quick snack  they are satisfying even if you have a sweet tooth  i love that they are whole grain and have fiber  delicious  just wish there weren t raisins in them ', 'i love the quaker soft baked cookies   the really are soft and taste great   i tried the oatmeal raisin  and cant wait to try the other flavors   they all look really good ', 'this cookie is really good and works really well for my family   in the morning it fits in to my morning routine   i take the cookie put it in the microwave and out the door we go with my tea   something i can eat at my desk or on the run   it holds me over till lunch and is not too heavy ']\n",
